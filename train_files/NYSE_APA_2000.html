Quantities of natural gas are expressed in this report in terms of thousand cubic feet (Mcf), million cubic feet (MMcf) or billion cubic feet (Bcf). Oil is quantified in terms of barrels (bbls); thousands of barrels (Mbbls) and millions of barrels (MMbbls). Natural gas is compared to oil in terms of barrels of oil equivalent (boe) or million barrels of oil equivalent (MMboe). Oil and natural gas liquids are compared with natural gas in terms of million cubic feet equivalent (MMcfe) and billion cubic feet equivalent (Bcfe). One barrel of oil is the energy equivalent of six Mcf of natural gas. Daily oil and gas production is expressed in terms of barrels of oil per day (b/d) and thousands or millions of cubic feet of gas per day (Mcf/d and MMcf/d, respectively) or millions of British thermal units per day (MMBtu/d), respectively. Gas sales volumes may be expressed in terms of one million British thermal units (MMBtu), which is approximately, equal to one Mcf. With respect to information relating to the Company&#39;s working interest in wells or acreage, &quot;net&quot; oil and gas wells or acreage is determined by multiplying gross wells or acreage by the Company&#39;s working interest therein. Unless otherwise specified, all references to wells and acres are gross.</p><h2 style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">PART I</h2><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h2 style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 220%;text-align: left;">ITEM 1. BUSINESS GENERAL</h2><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Apache Corporation (Apache or the Company), a Delaware corporation formed in 1954, is an independent energy company that explores for, develops and produces natural gas, crude oil and natural gas liquids. In North America, Apache&#39;s exploration and production interests are focused on the Gulf of Mexico, the Anadarko Basin, the Permian Basin, the Gulf Coast and the Western Sedimentary Basin of Canada. Outside of North America, Apache has exploration and production interests offshore Western Australia and in Egypt and exploration interests in Poland and offshore The People&#39;s Republic of China (China). Apache common stock, par value $1.25 per share, has been listed on the New York Stock Exchange since 1969, and on the Chicago Stock Exchange since 1960.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Apache holds interests in many of its U.S., Canadian and international properties through operating subsidiaries, such as Apache Canada Ltd., DEK Energy Company (DEKALB, formerly known as DEKALB Energy Company), Apache Energy Limited (formerly known as Hadson Energy Limited), Apache International, Inc., and Apache Overseas, Inc. Properties referred to in this document may be held by those subsidiaries. Apache treats all operations as one line of business.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h2 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">1999 RESULTS</h2><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In 1999, Apache had record net income attributable to common stock of $186.4 million, or $1.73 per share, on total revenues of $1.3 billion. Net cash provided by operating activities during 1999 was $638.2 million, a 35 percent increase from 1998.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Apache reported its 22nd consecutive year of production growth (up 17 percent) and 12th consecutive year of oil and gas reserves growth (up 32 percent) in 1999. Apache&#39;s average daily production was 95 Mbbls of oil and natural gas liquids and 656 MMcf of natural gas for the year. Giving effect to 1999 production, acquisitions, dispositions, revisions and drilling activity, the Company&#39;s estimated proved reserves increased by 194 MMboe in 1999 over the prior year to 807 MMboe, of which approximately 49 percent was natural gas. Based on 613 MMboe reported at year-end 1998, Apache&#39;s reserve additions (including revisions) during the year reflect replacement of 416 percent of the Company&#39;s 1999 production. Apache&#39;s drilling and production-enhancement program yielded 190 new producing wells out of 252 attempts and involved 579 major North American workover and recompletion projects during the year.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">At December 31, 1999, Apache held interests in approximately 4,307 net oil and gas wells and 2,148,620 net developed acres of oil and gas properties worldwide. In addition, the Company had approximately 977,292 net undeveloped acres under North American leases and 18,755,419 net undeveloped acres under international exploration and production rights.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h2 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">APACHE&#39;S GROWTH STRATEGY</h2><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Apache&#39;s growth strategy is to increase oil and gas reserves, production, cash flow and earnings through a combination of exploratory drilling, development of its inventory of existing projects, and property acquisitions meeting defined financial parameters. The Company&#39;s drilling program emphasizes reserve additions through low to moderate-risk drilling primarily on its North American interests, and exploratory and subsequent development drilling primarily on its international interests. The Company also emphasizes reducing operating costs per unit produced and selling marginal and non-strategic properties in order to enhance its profit margins.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Apache&#39;s international exploration activities are an emerging component of its long-term growth strategy. In addition to active, low to moderate-risk drilling and exploration activities in Apache&#39;s North American focus areas, higher-risk international exploration offers potential for greater rewards and significant reserve additions. Apache directed its international efforts in 1999 toward development of certain discoveries offshore Western Australia and in Egypt and toward further exploration efforts in those areas and on its concessions in</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">1</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Poland. Apache believes that reserve additions in these international areas are likely to continue through higher-risk exploration and through appraisal and development drilling of prior exploratory discoveries.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">For Apache, property acquisition is only one phase in a continuing cycle of business growth. Apache&#39;s aim is to follow each acquisition with a cycle of reserve enhancement, property consolidation and cash flow acceleration, facilitating asset growth and debt reduction. This approach requires a well planned and carefully executed property development program and, where appropriate, a selective program of property dispositions. It motivates Apache to target acquisitions that have ascertainable additional reserve potential and to apply an active drilling, workover and recompletion program to realize the potential of the acquired undeveloped and partially developed properties. Apache prefers to operate its properties so that it can best influence their development; as a result, the Company operates properties accounting for 82 percent of its production.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h2 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">1999 ACQUISITIONS AND DISPOSITIONS</h2><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">On February 1, 1999, the Company acquired oil and gas properties located in the Gulf of Mexico from Petsec Energy Inc. (Petsec) for an adjusted purchase price of $67.7 million. The Petsec transaction included estimated proved reserves of approximately 10.2 MMboe as of the acquisition date.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">On May 18, 1999, Apache acquired from Shell Offshore Inc. and affiliated Shell entities (Shell Offshore) its interest in 22 producing fields and 16 undeveloped blocks located in the Gulf of Mexico. The transaction also included certain production-related assets and proprietary 2-D and 3-D seismic data covering approximately 1,000 blocks in the Gulf of Mexico. The purchase price was $687.7 million in cash and one million shares of Apache common stock (valued at $28.125 million). The Shell Offshore acquisition included approximately 123.2 MMboe of proved reserves as of the acquisition date.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">On June 18, 1999, Apache acquired a 10 percent interest in the East Spar Joint Venture and an 8.4 percent interest in the Harriet Joint Venture, both located in the Carnarvon Basin (offshore Western Australia), from British-Borneo Oil and Gas Plc (British-Borneo) for $83.6 million cash and working interests in 11 leases in the Gulf of Mexico. The British-Borneo transaction included approximately 16.8 MMboe of proved reserves as of the acquisition date.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">On November 30, 1999, Apache acquired from Shell Canada Limited (Shell Canada) producing properties and other assets for C$761 million (US$517.8 million). The producing properties consisted of 150,400 net acres and comprised 20 fields with an average working interest of 55 percent and proved reserves of</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">87.2 MMboe as of the acquisition date. Apache also acquired 294,294 net acres of undeveloped leaseholdings, a 100 percent interest in a gas processing plant with a potential throughput capacity of 160 MMcf per day, and 52,700 square miles of 2-D seismic and 884 square miles of 3- D seismic.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In 1999, the Company also completed tactical regional acquisitions for cash consideration totaling $17.7 million. These acquisitions added approximately 8.8 MMboe to the Company&#39;s proved reserves.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">On September 3, 1999, Apache sold its holdings in the Ivory Coast by selling its wholly owned subsidiary, Apache Cote d&#39;Ivoire Petroleum LDC, for a total sales price of $46.1 million to a consortium consisting of Mondoil Cote d&#39;Ivoire LLC and Saur Energie Cote d&#39;Ivoire. The sale consisted of 13.7 MMboe of proved reserves and a gain was recorded to other revenues in the accompanying statement of consolidated operations. Also, during 1999, Apache sold 27.9 MMboe of proved reserves in several transactions from largely marginal North American properties for $110 million.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h2 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION</h2><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Company&#39;s North American exploration and production activities are diversified among four operating regions: Offshore, Midcontinent, Southern and Canada. In July 1999, the Company combined its former Western region and the onshore properties from its former Gulf region to form the new Southern region, leaving its offshore properties in the renamed Offshore region. Approximately 73 percent of the Company&#39;s proved reserves are located in these North American regions. Egypt and Australia are the Company&#39;s most important international regions. The Company&#39;s Egyptian operations are headquartered in Cairo, and Apache conducts its Australian exploration and production operations from Perth. Information concerning the amount of revenue, operating income (loss) and total assets attributable to U.S., Canadian and</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">2</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">international operations is set forth in Note 12 to the Company&#39;s consolidated financial statements under Item 8 below.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Offshore. The Offshore region comprises the Company&#39;s interests in the Gulf of Mexico, offshore Louisiana and Texas. In 1999, the Offshore region was Apache&#39;s leading region for production and production revenues contributing approximately $346.2 million in revenues from production of 21.3 MMboe for the year. The Company performed 110 workover and recompletion operations during 1999 in the offshore region and participated in drilling 24 wells, 16 of which were completed as producers. As of December 31, 1999, the region encompassed 482,204 net acres, and accounted for 146.8 MMboe, or 18 percent, of the Company&#39;s year-end 1999 total estimated proved reserves.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Midcontinent. Apache&#39;s Midcontinent region operates in Oklahoma, eastern and northern Texas, Arkansas and northern Louisiana. The region has focused operations on its sizable position in the Anadarko Basin of western Oklahoma. Apache has drilled and operated in the Anadarko Basin for over four decades, developing an extensive database of geologic information and a substantial acreage position. In 1999, the Midcontinent region had approximately 10.5 MMboe of production generating $143.7 million in revenue for the Company.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">At December 31, 1999, Apache held an interest in 391,935 net acres in the region, which accounted for approximately 88.1 MMboe, or 11 percent, of Apache&#39;s total estimated proved reserves. Apache participated in drilling 48 wells in the Midcontinent region during the year, 40 of which were completed as producing wells. The Company performed 50 workover and recompletion operations in the region during 1999.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Southern. The Southern region includes assets in the Permian Basin of western Texas and New Mexico, the San Juan Basin of New Mexico, Central Texas, and the Texas and Louisiana coasts. In 1999, the Southern region produced approximately 14.1 MMboe and generated $212.3 million in production revenue. At December 31, 1999, the Company held 626,241 net acres in the region, which accounted for 206.3 MMboe, or 26 percent, of the Company&#39;s total estimated proved reserves. Apache participated in drilling 58 wells in the Southern region, 52 of which were productive wells. Apache performed 350 workovers and recompletions in the Southern region during the year.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Canada. Exploration and development activity in the Canadian region is concentrated in the Provinces of Alberta and British Columbia. The region produced approximately 7.4 MMboe and generated $86.9 million in production revenue in 1999. Apache participated in drilling 49 wells in this region during the year, 32 of which were completed as producers. The Company performed 69 workovers and recompletions on operated wells during 1999. At December 31, 1999, the region encompassed approximately 896,701 net acres, and accounted for 150.9 MMboe, or 19 percent, of the Company&#39;s year-end 1999 total estimated proved reserves.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Egypt. At year end, Apache held 11,803,569 net acres in Egypt with 65.1 MMboe of estimated proved reserves or eight percent of Apache&#39;s total estimated proved reserves. In 1999, Apache had 12.6 MMboe of production in Egypt, which generated $235.9 million in production revenues. Apache owns a 75 percent interest in the Qarun Block and a 40 percent interest in the Khalda Block, both located in the Western Desert of Egypt. Production of gas from Khalda is delivered for sale to the Egyptian General Petroleum Corporation (EGPC) at a point west of Alexandria, Egypt, via a 34-inch gas pipeline, construction of which commenced in 1997 and was completed in August 1999. Additional gas will be delivered via a southern line expected to be completed mid-year 2000. The costs of building the pipeline were borne by Apache, the other Khalda participants, and the owners of a neighboring block and are recoverable from oil and gas production from the Khalda Block.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In addition to the Qarun and Khalda Blocks, Apache holds interests in the East Beni Suef and Asyout Blocks to the south of the Qarun Block, and three other blocks in the Western Desert of Egypt, the North East Abu Gharadig Block, the East Bahariya Block, and the West Mediterranean Block No. 1 (partly onshore and partly offshore). Apache also acquired interests in the Ras El Hekma and Ras Kanayes concessions from Repsol Exploracion Egipto S.A. in December 1997.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">3</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">On November 30, 1999 Apache acquired from Amoco Egypt 100 percent of the working interest in the WD-19 area in the Western Desert. This area has produced oil in the past, but is currently inactive. Apache intends to drill additional wells and, if successful, to tie them into adjoining Qarun facilities.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Both the Khalda and Qarun Concession Agreements provide that Apache and its partners in the concessions will pay all of the operating and capital costs for developing the concessions, while the production will be split between EGPC and the partners. Up to 40 percent of the oil and gas produced from each of the concessions is available to the Company and its partners to recover operating and capital costs for the applicable concession. To the extent eligible costs exceed 40 percent of the oil and gas produced and sold from a concession in any given quarter, such excess costs may be carried into future quarters without limit. The remaining 60 percent of all oil and gas produced from the concessions is divided between EGPC and Apache and its partners, with the percentage received by Apache and its partners reducing as the gross daily average of oil and gas produced on a quarterly basis increases. Under the Khalda Agreement, capital costs are amortized over four years, while the Qarun agreement provides for a five-year amortization.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Australia. Western Australia became an important region for Apache after the 1993 acquisition of Hadson Energy Resources Corporation (subsequently known as Apache Energy Resources Corporation). In 1999, natural gas production in the region increased by 51 percent from the prior year to approximately 76 MMcf/d. Apache acts as operator for most of its Western Australian properties through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Apache Energy Limited (AEL). During 1999, Apache had 8.5 MMboe of production generating $118.5 million of production revenue. Estimated proved reserves in Australia increased by 13 percent to 150.1 MMboe, or 19 percent of the Company&#39;s year-end total estimated proved reserves. The increase reflects, among other matters, the 1999 acquisition from British-Borneo of holdings in the East Spar and Harriet fields. As of December 31, 1999, Apache held 259,240 net developed acres and 1,664,440 net undeveloped acres offshore Western Australia. Through AEL and its subsidiaries, Apache also operates the Varanus Island gas hub with a throughput capacity of 240 MMcf/d and two 60-mile (12-inch and 16-inch) pipelines from Varanus Island to connections with the Dampier to Bunbury and Goldfields Gas Transmission pipelines. See &quot;1999 Acquisitions and Dispositions&quot; and &quot;Oil and Natural Gas Marketing.&quot;</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Other International Operations. Outside of Canada, Egypt and Australia, Apache currently has exploration interests in Poland and offshore China.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Apache obtained its first properties in Poland on April 16, 1997, when the Company assumed operatorship and a 50 percent interest in over 5.5 million acres in Poland located near Lublin, southeast of Warsaw, from FX Energy, Inc. (FX Energy). The Company has since acquired additional acreage in Poland, including approximately 1.8 million acres in the Carpathian area near the southern border of Poland and participation in a further 2.275 million acres in the Pomeranian area of northwest Poland, giving Apache interests in 11,468,335 total gross undeveloped acres and 5,734,169 net undeveloped acres as of December 31, 1999. Apache is obligated to drill at least ten wells and to shoot at least 1,250 miles of seismic data in Poland. At year end, drilling operations on the first five exploratory wells had been completed, and all were determined to be exploratory dry holes. Subsequent to year end, a sixth well, known as the Wilga well, tested at a combined rate of 16.9 MMcf of gas and 570 barrels of condensate per day. The well is located on Block 255 of the Vistula Concession in the Lublin basin. Apache and FX Energy plan to enter into further exploration and production agreements with the Polish Oil and Gas Company (POGC), the national oil company of Poland. Apache&#39;s operations in Poland are headquartered in Warsaw.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Apache is also the operator, with a 50 percent interest, of the Zhao Dong Block in Bohai Bay, offshore China. In 1994 and 1995, discovery wells tested at rates between 1,300 and 4,000 b/d of oil. The Company elected to proceed with the second exploration phase, commencing in May 1996, which involved a commitment to drill two additional exploratory wells. In early 1997, one well tested at rates up to 11,571 b/d of oil and another tested at rates up to 15,359 b/d. An overall development plan for the C and D Fields in the Zhao Dong Block was submitted to Chinese authorities in late 1997 and is awaiting approval.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">On May 28, 1999, Apache China Corporation LDC (Apache China, an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of the Company) sent a notice of default to XCL-China, Ltd. (XCL-China), a participant with Apache China in the Zhao Dong Block offshore the People&#39;s Republic of China, and its parent company, XCL, Ltd.,</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">4</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">for the failure to pay approximately $10 million of costs pursuant to the agreements governing the project. Prior to the expiration of the cure period, XCL-China and XCL, Ltd. filed petitions initiating arbitration proceedings against Apache China. The actions seek to disallow approximately $17 million in costs expended by Apache China related to developing the Zhao Dong Block, including the $10 million in costs billed by Apache China to XCL-China that have not been paid. In addition, XCL-China has advised Apache China of XCL-China&#39;s intent to seek the removal of Apache China as operator of the Block. Apache China has denied the allegations made by XCL-China in its petition and is vigorously contesting them. On November 30, 1999 the arbitration proceedings were stayed in connection with the bankruptcy proceeding described below.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">On June 25, 1999, Apache China filed a petition in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Opelousas, Louisiana, to place XCL-China into involuntary bankruptcy under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code on account of XCL-China&#39;s failure to pay its share of costs related to development of the Zhao Dong Block. On December 21, 1999, the holders of XCL, Ltd.&#39;s senior secured notes, acting through their Trustee, exercised their remedial rights under their indenture and removed the existing Board of Directors of XCL-China, electing a new Board. The new Board of Directors of XCL-China voted to withdraw XCL-China&#39;s opposition to Apache China&#39;s Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition filed against XCL-China and on December 22, 1999 obtained an order of the Court converting the proceeding into a voluntary Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceeding.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Apache China has entered into negotiations with the Chinese authorities concerning the terms and conditions of the development of the Zhao Dong Block including, among other things the portion of XCL-China&#39;s future development costs to be paid by the Chinese. Apache China is prepared to move forward as soon as these negotiations are satisfactorily concluded.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In September 1999, Apache sold its interests in the Ivory Coast as detailed in &quot;1999 Acquisitions and Dispositions&quot; above.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h2 style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">OIL AND NATURAL GAS MARKETING</h2><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">On October 27, 1995, wholly owned affiliates of each of Apache, Oryx Energy Company and Parker &amp; Parsley Petroleum Company (Parker &amp; Parsley) formed Producers Energy Marketing LLC (ProEnergy), a Delaware limited liability company. ProEnergy became fully operational on April 1, 1996, and marketed substantially all of its members&#39; domestic natural gas pursuant to member gas purchase agreements having an initial term of 10 years, subject to early termination following specified events. The price of gas purchased by ProEnergy from its members was based upon agreed to published indexes. Effective January 1, 1998, Parker &amp; Parsley withdrew from ProEnergy. In June 1998, Apache sold its interest in ProEnergy to Cinergy Corp. (Cinergy) and formed a strategic alliance with Cinergy to market substantially all the Company&#39;s natural gas production from North America. ProEnergy, renamed Cinergy Marketing &amp; Trading, LLC in June 1999, will continue to market Apache&#39;s North American natural gas production for 10 years, with an option to terminate after six years, under an amended and restated gas purchase agreement effective July 1, 1998. During this period, Apache is generally obligated to deliver most of its North American gas production to Cinergy and, under certain circumstances, may have to make payments to Cinergy if certain gas throughput thresholds are not met.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Separate from its arrangements with Cinergy, Apache is also delivering natural gas under several long-term supply agreements with terms greater than one year.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Apache assumed its own U.S. crude oil marketing operations in 1992. Most of Apache&#39;s U.S. crude oil production is sold through lease-level marketing to refiners, traders and transporters, generally under 30 day contracts that renew automatically until canceled. Oil produced from Canadian properties is sold to crude oil purchasers or refiners at market prices, which depend on worldwide crude prices adjusted for transportation and crude quality. Natural gas produced from Canadian properties is sold to major aggregators of natural gas, gas marketers and direct users under long-term and short-term contracts. The oil and gas contracts provide for sales at specified prices, or at prices that are subject to change due to market conditions.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Company diversifies the markets for its Canadian gas production not presently committed to Cinergy by selling directly or indirectly to customers through aggregators and brokers in the United States and Canada.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">5</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Apache transports natural gas via the Company&#39;s firm transportation contracts to California (12 MMcf/d) and to the Province of Ontario, Canada (four MMcf/d) through end-users&#39; firm transportation contracts. Pursuant to an agreement entered into in 1994, the Company is also selling five MMcf/d of natural gas to the Hermiston Cogeneration Project, located in the Pacific Northwest of the United States. In 1996, the Company entered into an agreement with Westcoast Gas Services, Inc. for the sale of 5,000 MMBtu/d for delivery in the United States for a 10 year term.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In Australia, the Company entered into two gas sales contracts during 1999, bringing its total to 18 contracts, with terms of four to 12 years to deliver 323 Bcf of AEL&#39;s gas from its Harriet and East Spar fields for mining, power generation, nickel refining, ammonia production and other industrial and domestic uses. Under these contracts AEL is required to deliver its gas at contract rates of approximately 111 MMcf/day increasing to 135 MMcf/d by mid 2000, with take or pay provisions, net to AEL, of approximately 28 Bcf/year increasing to 49 Bcf/year by the end of 2001. Apache operates both the Harriet and East Spar Joint Ventures, holding a 68.5 percent interest in Harriet and a 55 percent interest in East Spar.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In Egypt, oil from the Qarun Block is delivered by pipeline to tanks owned by the Company and its partners in the Qarun Concession at the Dashour pumping station northeast of the Qarun Block or by truck to the Tebbin refinery south of Alexandria, Egypt. At the discretion of the operator of the pipelines, oil from the Qarun Block is put into the two 42-inch diameter SUMED pipelines, which transport significant quantities of Egyptian and other crude oil from the Gulf of Suez to Sidi Kherir, west of Alexandria, Egypt, on the Mediterranean Coast. All Qarun and Khalda crude oil is currently sold to EGPC. In 1996, the Company and its partners in the Khalda Block entered into a take or pay contract with EGPC, which obligates EGPC to pay for 75 percent of 200 MMcf/d of future production of gas from the Khalda Block. Sales of gas under the contract began in 1999 upon completion of a gas pipeline from the Khalda Block. In late 1997, the same sellers entered into a supplement to the contract with EGPC to sell an additional 50 MMcf/d through a southern gas line being constructed by the Company and its partners from the Khalda Block to a point near the Qarun Block to tie into an existing gas pipeline. This southern line is expected to complete tie-in in mid-year 2000.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h2 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">OIL AND NATURAL GAS PRICES</h2><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Natural gas prices remained volatile during 1999, with Apache&#39;s realized prices ranging from $1.60 per Mcf in March to $2.74 per Mcf in November. Fluctuations are largely due to market perceptions about natural gas supply and demand. Apache&#39;s average realized gas price of</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">$2.16 per Mcf for 1999 was up 13 percent from the prior-year average of $1.92 per Mcf, and its 1998 average realized natural gas price was 16 percent lower than the 1997 average price of $2.28 per Mcf.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">As a result of minimum price contracts which escalate at an average of 80 percent of the Australian consumer price index, AEL&#39;s natural gas production in Western Australia is not subject to price volatility as is Apache&#39;s U.S. and Canadian gas production; however, natural gas sales under such Australian minimum price contracts represented approximately 10.3 percent of the Company&#39;s total natural gas sales at the end of 1999. Total Australian gas sales in 1999, including long-term contracts and spot sales averaged $1.51 per Mcf, equal to the 1998 average.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In Egypt, all oil production from the East Beni Suef, Khalda, West Mediterranean and Qarun Blocks is currently sold to EGPC on a spot basis at a &quot;Western Desert&quot; price, which is applied to virtually all production from the area and is announced periodically by EGPC. In 1999, the average price was $18.63 per barrel. Discussions with EGPC regarding the possibility of exporting Qarun oil production are continuing. Gas sales from the Khalda Block commenced in 1999 based on a contract price that is equivalent to 85 percent of the price of Suez Blend crude oil, FOB Mediterranean.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Oil prices remained subject to unpredictable political and economic forces during 1999 and experienced fluctuations similar to those seen in natural gas prices for the year, but showing a significant upward trend. Apache believes that oil prices will continue to fluctuate in response to changes in the policies of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), demand from Asian countries, events in the Middle East and other factors associated with the world political and economic environment. As a result of the many</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">6</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">uncertainties associated with levels of production maintained by OPEC and other oil producing countries, the availabilities of worldwide energy supplies and the competitive relationships and consumer perceptions of various energy sources, the Company is unable to predict what changes will occur in crude oil and natural gas prices.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In 1999, Apache&#39;s realized worldwide crude oil price ranged from $10.09 per barrel in February to $24.11 per barrel in December. The average crude oil price of $18.43 per barrel in 1999 was up 46 percent from the average price of $12.66 per barrel in 1998, and four percent lower than the average price of $19.20 per barrel in 1997. The Company&#39;s average crude oil price for its Australian production was $19.70 per barrel in 1999, 51 percent more than the average price in 1998.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">From time to time, Apache buys or sells contracts to hedge a limited portion of its future oil and gas production against exposure to spot market price changes. See Note 9 to the Company&#39;s consolidated financial statements under Item 8 below.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Company&#39;s business has been and will continue to be affected by future worldwide changes in oil and gas prices and the relationship between the prices of oil and gas. No assurance can be given as to the trend in, or level of, future oil and gas prices.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h2 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">WRITE-DOWNS UNDER THE FULL COST CEILING TEST RULES</h2><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Under the full cost accounting rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the Company reviews the carrying value of its proved oil and gas properties each quarter on a country-by-country basis. Under these rules, capitalized costs of proved oil and gas properties, net of accumulated depreciation, depletion and amortization, and deferred income taxes, may not exceed the present value of estimated future net cash flows from proved oil and gas reserves, discounted at 10 percent, plus the lower of cost or fair value of unproved properties included in the costs being amortized, net of related tax effects. These rules generally require pricing future oil and gas production at the unescalated oil and gas prices in effect at the end of each fiscal quarter and require a write-down if the &quot;ceiling&quot; is exceeded, even if prices declined for only a short period of time. The Company recorded a write-down in 1998, but had no write-downs due to ceiling test limitations in 1999. Given the volatility of oil and gas prices, it is reasonably possible that the Company&#39;s estimate of discounted future net cash flows from proved oil and gas reserves could change in the near term. If oil and gas prices decline significantly in the future, even if only for a short period of time, it is possible that additional write-downs of oil and gas properties could occur. Write-downs required by these rules do not impact cash flow from operating activities.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h2 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">VOLATILE PRICES CAN MATERIALLY AFFECT THE COMPANY</h2><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Company continually analyzes, forecasts and updates its estimates of energy prices for its internal use in planning, budgeting, and estimating and valuing reserves. The Company&#39;s future financial condition and results of operations will depend upon the prices received for the Company&#39;s oil and natural gas production and the costs of acquiring, finding, developing and producing reserves. Prices for oil and natural gas are subject to fluctuations in response to relatively minor changes in supply, market uncertainty and a variety of additional factors that are beyond the control of the Company. These factors include worldwide political instability (especially in the Middle East and other oil-producing regions), the foreign supply of oil and gas, the price of foreign imports, the level of drilling activity, the level of consumer product demand, government regulations and taxes, the price and availability of alternative fuels and the overall economic environment. A substantial or extended decline in oil and gas prices would have a material adverse effect on the Company&#39;s financial position, results of operations, quantities of oil and gas that may be economically produced, and access to capital. Oil and natural gas prices have historically been and are likely to continue to be volatile. This volatility makes it difficult to estimate with precision the value of producing properties in acquisitions and to budget and project the return on exploration and development projects involving the Company&#39;s oil and gas properties. In addition, unusually volatile prices often disrupt the market for oil and gas properties, as buyers and sellers have more difficulty agreeing on the purchase price of properties.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">7</p><h2 style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">UNCERTAINTY IN CALCULATING RESERVES; RATES OF PRODUCTION; DEVELOPMENT EXPENDITURES; CASH FLOWS</h2><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of oil and natural gas reserves of any category and in projecting future rates of production and timing of development expenditures, which underlie the reserve estimates, including many factors beyond the Company&#39;s control. Reserve data represent only estimates. In addition, the estimates of future net cash flows from the Company&#39;s proved reserves and their present value are based upon various assumptions about future production levels, prices and costs that may prove to be incorrect over time.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Any significant variance from the assumptions could result in the actual quantity of the Company&#39;s reserves and future net cash flows from them being materially different from the estimates. In addition, the Company&#39;s estimated reserves may be subject to downward or upward revision based upon production history, results of future exploration and development, prevailing oil and gas prices, operating and development costs and other factors.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h2 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">ACQUISITION OR DISCOVERIES OF ADDITIONAL RESERVES IS NEEDED TO AVOID A MATERIAL DECLINE IN RESERVES AND PRODUCTION</h2><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The rate of production from oil and gas properties generally declines as reserves are depleted. Except to the extent that the Company acquires additional properties containing proved reserves, conducts successful exploration and development activities or, through engineering studies, identifies additional behind-pipe zones or secondary recovery reserves, the Company&#39;s proved reserves will decline materially as reserves are produced. Future oil and gas production is, therefore, highly dependent upon the Company&#39;s level of success in acquiring or finding additional reserves.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h2 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">SUBSTANTIAL COSTS INCURRED TO CONFORM TO GOVERNMENT REGULATION OF THE OIL AND GAS INDUSTRY</h2><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Company&#39;s exploration, production and marketing operations are regulated extensively at the federal, state and local levels, as well as by other countries in which the Company does business. The Company has made and will continue to make large expenditures in its efforts to comply with the requirements of environmental and other regulations. Further, the oil and gas regulatory environment could change in ways that might substantially increase these costs. Hydrocarbon-producing states regulate conservation practices and the protection of correlative rights. These regulations affect the Company&#39;s operations and limit the quantity of hydrocarbons the Company may produce and sell. In addition, at the U.S. federal level, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission regulates interstate transportation of natural gas under the Natural Gas Act. Other regulated matters include marketing, pricing, transportation and valuation of royalty payments.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h2 style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">SUBSTANTIAL COSTS INCURRED RELATED TO ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS</h2><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Company, as an owner or lessee and operator of oil and gas properties, is subject to various federal, provincial, state, local and foreign country laws and regulations relating to discharge of materials into, and protection of, the environment. These laws and regulations may, among other things, impose liability on the lessee under an oil and gas lease for the cost of pollution clean-up resulting from operations, subject the lessee to liability for pollution damages, and require suspension or cessation of operations in affected areas.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Company maintains insurance coverage, which it believes is customary in the industry, although it is not fully insured against all environmental risks. The Company is not aware of any environmental claims existing as of December 31, 1999, which would have a material impact upon the Company&#39;s financial position or results of operations.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Company has made and will continue to make expenditures in its efforts to comply with these requirements, which it believes are necessary business costs in the oil and gas industry. The Company has established policies for continuing compliance with environmental laws and regulations, including regulations applicable to its operations in Canada, Australia and other countries. Apache also has established operational procedures and training programs designed to minimize the environmental impact of its field facilities. The costs incurred by these policies and procedures are inextricably connected to normal operating expenses such</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">8</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">that the Company is unable to separate the expenses related to environmental matters; however, the Company does not believe any such additional expenses are material to its financial position or results of operations.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Although environmental requirements have a substantial impact upon the energy industry, generally these requirements do not appear to affect Apache any differently, or to any greater or lesser extent, than other companies in the industry. The Company does not believe that compliance with federal, state, local or foreign country provisions regulating the discharge of materials into the environment, or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment, will have a material adverse effect upon the capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position of the Company or its subsidiaries; however, there is no assurance that changes in or additions to laws or regulations regarding the protection of the environment will not have such an impact.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h2 style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">COMPETITION WITH OTHER COMPANIES COULD HARM THE COMPANY</h2><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The oil and gas industry is highly competitive. The Company&#39;s business could be harmed by competition with other companies. Because oil and gas are fungible commodities, the Company&#39;s principal form of competition is price competition. The Company strives to maintain the lowest finding and production costs possible to maximize profits. In addition, as an independent oil and gas company, the Company frequently competes for reserve acquisitions, exploration leases, licenses, concessions and marketing agreements against companies with financial and other resources substantially larger than the Company possesses. Many of the Company&#39;s competitors have established strategic long-term positions and maintain strong governmental relationships in countries in which the Company may seek new entry.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h2 style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">INSURANCE DOES NOT COVER ALL RISKS</h2><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Exploration for and production of oil and natural gas can be hazardous, involving unforeseen occurrences such as blowouts, cratering, fires and loss of well control, which can result in damage to or destruction of wells or production facilities, injury to persons, loss of life, or damage to property or the environment. The Company maintains insurance against certain losses or liabilities arising from its operations in accordance with customary industry practices and in amounts that management believes to be prudent; however, insurance is not available to the Company against all operational risks.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h2 style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">HEDGING MAY PREVENT THE COMPANY FROM FULLY BENEFITING FROM PRICE INCREASES</h2><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">To the extent that the Company engages in hedging activities, it may be prevented from realizing the benefits of price increases above the levels of the hedges. In addition, the Company is subject to basis risk when it engages in hedging transactions, particularly where transportation constraints restrict the Company&#39;s ability to deliver oil and gas volumes at the delivery point to which the hedging transaction is indexed.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h2 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">RISKS ARISING FROM THE FAILURE TO FULLY IDENTIFY POTENTIAL PROBLEMS RELATED TO ACQUIRED RESERVES OR TO PROPERLY ESTIMATE THOSE RESERVES</h2><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Company from time to time acquires oil and gas properties. Although the Company performs a review of the acquired properties that it believes is consistent with industry practices, such reviews are inherently incomplete. It generally is not feasible to review in depth every individual property involved in each acquisition. Ordinarily the Company will focus its review efforts on the higher-value properties and will sample the remainder. However, even a detailed review of records and properties may not necessarily reveal existing or potential problems, nor will it permit a buyer to become sufficiently familiar with the properties to assess fully their deficiencies and potential. Inspections may not always be performed on every well, and environmental problems, such as ground water contamination, are not necessarily observable even when an inspection is undertaken. Even when problems are identified, the Company often assumes certain environmental and other risks and liabilities in connection with acquired properties. There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved oil and gas reserves and actual future production rates and associated costs with respect to acquired properties, and actual results may vary substantially from those assumed in the estimates (see above). In addition, there can be no assurance that acquisitions will not have an adverse effect</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">9</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">upon the Company&#39;s operating results, particularly during the periods in which the operations of acquired businesses are being integrated into the Company&#39;s ongoing operations.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h2 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS</h2><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Virtually all of the Company&#39;s operations are subject to the risks and uncertainties of adverse changes in general economic conditions (domestically, in specific regions of the United States and Canada, and internationally), the outcome of pending and/or potential legal or regulatory proceedings, changes in environmental, tax, labor and other laws and regulations to which the Company is subject, and the condition of the capital markets utilized by the Company to finance its operations.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h2 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">RISKS OF NON-U.S. OPERATIONS</h2><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Company&#39;s non-U.S. oil and natural gas exploration, development and production activities are subject to: political and economic uncertainties, including, among others, changes, sometimes frequent or marked, in governmental energy policies or the personnel administering them; expropriation of property; cancellation or modification of contract rights; foreign exchange restrictions; currency fluctuations; risks of loss due to civil strife, acts of war, guerrilla activities and insurrection; royalty and tax increases; and other risks arising out of foreign governmental sovereignty over the areas in which the Company&#39;s operations are conducted. These risks may be higher in the developing countries in which the Company conducts these activities. Consequently, the Company&#39;s non-U.S. exploration, development and production activities may be substantially affected by factors beyond the Company&#39;s control, any of which could materially adversely affect the Company&#39;s financial position or results of operations. Furthermore, in the event of a dispute arising from non-U.S. operations, the Company may be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of courts outside the United States or may not be successful in subjecting non-U.S. persons to the jurisdiction of the courts in the United States, which could adversely affect the outcome of the dispute.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h2 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">EFFECT OF CHANGES IN FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES ON THE COMPANY&#39;S CASH FLOW</h2><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Company&#39;s cash flow stream relating to certain international operations is based on the U.S. dollar equivalent of cash flows measured in foreign currencies. Australian gas production is sold under fixed-price Australian dollar contracts and over half the costs incurred are paid in Australian dollars. Revenue and disbursement transactions denominated in Australian dollars are converted to U.S. dollar equivalents based on the exchange rate on the transaction date. Reported cash flow relating to Canadian operations is based on cash flows measured in Canadian dollars converted to the U.S. dollar equivalent based on the average of the Canadian and U.S. dollar exchange rates for the period reported.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Substantially all of the Company&#39;s international transactions, outside of Canada and Australia, are denominated in U.S. dollars. The Company&#39;s Polish and Australian subsidiaries have net financial assets that are denominated in a currency other than the functional reporting currency of the subsidiaries. The Company considers its current risk exposure to exchange rate movements, based on net cash flows, to be immaterial.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h2 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">EMPLOYEES</h2><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">On December 31, 1999, Apache had 1,429 employees.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h2 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">OFFICES</h2><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Apache&#39;s principal executive offices are located at One Post Oak Central, 2000 Post Oak Boulevard, Suite 100, Houston, Texas 77056-4400.

In addition, if a person or group becomes the beneficial owner of 20 percent or more of Apache&#39;s outstanding common stock (flip in event), each Right will become exercisable for shares of Apache&#39;s common stock at 50 percent of the then market price of the common stock. If a 20 percent shareholder of Apache acquires Apache, by merger or otherwise, in a transaction where Apache does not survive or in which Apache&#39;s common stock is changed or exchanged (flip over event), the Rights become exercisable for shares of the common stock of the company acquiring Apache at 50 percent of the then market price for Apache common stock. Any Rights that are or were beneficially owned by a person who has acquired 20 percent or more of the outstanding shares of Apache common stock and who engages in certain transactions or realizes the benefits of certain transactions with the Company will become void. The Company may redeem the Rights at $.01 per Right at any time until 10 business days after public announcement of a flip in event. The Rights will expire on January 31, 2006, unless earlier redeemed by the Company. Unless the Rights have been previously redeemed, all shares of Apache common stock issued by the Company after January 31, 1996 will include Rights.

MANAGEMENT&#39;S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OVERVIEW</h2><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Apache&#39;s considerable progress in 1999 and favorable outlook for continued growth were not fully reflected in the Company&#39;s stock price at year-end. While Wall Street turned its attention to technology stocks, Apache recorded its best year ever, paving the way for its 23rd consecutive year of production growth in 2000.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">1999 performance highlights include record:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><ul id="l2"><li style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">Production of 204.3 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day, up 17 percent.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p></li><li style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">Proved reserves of 807.2 MMboe, up 32 percent.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p></li><li style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">Net cash provided by operating activities of $638.2 million, up 35 percent.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p></li><li style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 220%;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">Net income attributable to common stock of $186.4 million, up $31.5 million over our 1997 record. More important than these milestones is the position they have left Apache for continued progress ahead.</p></li><li style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">$1.8 billion of capital expenditures brought into our fold quality assets with low operating costs and high margins. The two acquisitions from Shell coupled with first production from major development projects in Egypt and Australia contributed to a $.32 per boe decline in Apache&#39;s lease operating expense per equivalent barrel produced.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p></li><li style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">Record 1999 earnings coupled with $654.8 million of equity offerings reduced Apache&#39;s debt to 41.4 percent of capitalization, among the strongest in our sector and capable of funding substantial growth opportunities.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p></li><li style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">Rising production will generate substantial cash flow. While prices are always a wildcard, should they approximate levels indicated by the current New York Mercantile Exchange, Apache has the potential to achieve $1 billion of cash flow in 2000, adding fuel with which to act on opportunities that many of Apache&#39;s competitors are unable to capture.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In short, despite only partial recognition in our stock price, Apache&#39;s progress in 1999 puts the company in its strongest financial position ever to carry out its business strategy and continue to build lasting shareholder value.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Apache&#39;s results of operations and financial position for 1999 were also significantly impacted by the following factors:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Commodity Prices -- Apache&#39;s average realized oil price increased $5.77 per barrel from $12.66 per barrel in 1998 to $18.43 per barrel in 1999, increasing revenues by $153.6 million. The average realized price for natural gas increased $.24 per Mcf from $1.92 per Mcf in 1998 to $2.16 per Mcf in 1999, positively impacting revenues by $50.7 million.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Operations -- Oil production increased 25 percent in 1999 compared to the prior year. The increase was primarily due to the acquisition of certain blocks in the Gulf of Mexico from Shell Offshore, included since mid-May of 1999, the full-period impact of the acquisition of certain oil and gas interests in the Carnarvon Basin, offshore Western Australia, from Novus in November 1998 and production from Australia&#39;s Stag field which began in May 1998. The increase in oil production positively impacted revenues by $121.9 million. Gas production increased 11 percent, which increased revenues by $52.0 million. As with oil, gas increased in the U.S. due to the Shell Offshore acquisition. In Egypt, the Western Desert Gas Pipeline in the Khalda concession was completed and first sales commenced in August 1999.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h2 style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">RESULTS OF OPERATIONS</h2><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Apache reported 1999 income attributable to common stock of $186.4 million, up from a loss attributable to common stock of $131.4 million in 1998. A significant increase in oil and gas production revenues was</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">18</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">partially offset by higher recurring depreciation, depletion and amortization (DD&amp;A) expense, operating costs, preferred stock dividends, and administrative, selling and other (G&amp;A) expense. Basic net income (loss) per common share was $1.73 for 1999, as compared to $(1.34) in 1998. A loss attributable to common stock of $131.4 million was reported in 1998 as opposed to income attributable to common stock of</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">$154.9 million in 1997. The 1998 loss resulted from a full-cost ceiling write-down at year end. Results for 1998 were further hampered by sharp declines in oil and gas prices. Basic net income (loss) per common share was $(1.34) for 1998, as compared to basic net income per share of $1.71 in 1997.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Oil and gas production revenues increased 50 percent in 1999 to $1.1 billion as compared to $759.0 million in 1998. The increase resulted from a 46 percent increase in the average realized oil price, a 13 percent increase in the average realized natural gas price, a 25 percent increase in oil production and an 11 percent increase in natural gas production. Crude oil, including natural gas liquids, contributed 55 percent and natural gas contributed 45 percent of total oil and gas production revenues during 1999. Oil and gas production revenues decreased 23 percent in 1998 to</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">$759.0 million as compared to $983.8 million in 1997. The decrease resulted from a 34 percent decrease in the average realized oil price, a 16 percent decrease in the average realized price for natural gas and a three percent decrease in gas production. Crude oil, including natural gas liquids, contributed 45 percent and natural gas contributed 55 percent of oil and gas production revenues during 1998.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">19</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The table below presents, for the years indicated, the oil and gas production revenues, production and average prices received from sales of natural gas, oil and natural gas liquids.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Company&#39;s future financial condition and results of operations will depend upon prices received for its oil and natural gas production and the costs of finding, acquiring, developing and producing reserves. A</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">20</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">substantial portion of the Company&#39;s production is sold under market-sensitive contracts. Prices for oil and natural gas are subject to fluctuations in response to changes in supply, market uncertainty and a variety of other factors beyond the Company&#39;s control. These factors include worldwide political instability (especially in the Middle East), the foreign supply of oil and natural gas, the price of foreign imports, the level of consumer demand, and the price and availability of alternative fuels.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Natural gas revenues increased by 25 percent from 1998 to 1999 as a result of increased production volumes and realized prices. The average realized gas price increased 13 percent in 1999 positively affecting revenues by $50.7 million. U.S. natural gas production, which comprised 70 percent of the Company&#39;s worldwide gas production, sold at an average price of $2.31 per Mcf, nine percent higher than in 1998, positively impacting natural gas sales by $32.4 million. The Company periodically engages in hedging activities, including fixed-price physical contracts and financial contracts. Gains under long-term fixed-price physical contracts increased the gas price by $.02 per Mcf in 1999 while realized losses from open hedging positions negatively impacted the gas price by $.01 per Mcf in 1999.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">Natural gas production increased 66 million cubic feet per day (MMcf/d), or 11 percent, on a worldwide basis, favorably impacting revenue by</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">$52.0 million in 1999. In the United States, gas production increased 29.4 MMcf/d due to acquisition activities, primarily the Shell Offshore acquisition in 1999. Development activities and the impact of producing property acquisitions during late 1998 increased natural gas production in Australia by 25.6 MMcf/d. Egyptian gas production increased ten fold in 1999 as a result of the completion of the northern portion of the Western Desert Gas Pipeline in the Khalda concession, with first sales commencing in August.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Natural gas revenues decreased by 18 percent from 1997 to 1998 due to lower natural gas prices and production. The average realized gas price received in 1998 was $1.92 per Mcf, 16 percent lower than 1997, negatively affecting revenue by $78.6 million. The Company periodically engages in hedging activities, including fixed-price physical contracts and financial contracts. Apache realized gains from open hedging positions favorably impacting the gas price by $.01 per Mcf in 1998. Gains under long-term fixed-price physical contracts increased the gas price by $.05 per Mcf in 1998. Prices declined in the United States due to unfavorable market conditions. Natural gas prices in Australia declined 15 percent from 1997 resulting from the devaluation of the Australian dollar.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Natural gas production for the United States decreased 12 percent from 1997 to 1998 due to the impact of property sales in the Southern and Midcontinent regions, tropical storms in the Gulf of Mexico and natural depletion. In Australia, natural gas production increased 95 percent driven by a full year of incremental production from properties acquired in the year-end 1997 Ampolex Group Transaction. The 18 percent uplift in Canadian production resulted from development activity and Alberta royalty recoupments received for 1998. Alberta allows reduction in royalty for costs to build processing and transportation facilities.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Crude oil revenues totaled $612.3 million in 1999, an 82 percent increase from 1998 due to higher average realized oil prices and production increases. On a worldwide basis, average oil prices increased 46 percent to $18.43 per barrel positively impacting oil sales by $153.6 million. Realized losses from open hedging positions negatively impacted the oil price by $.16 per barrel in 1999. Oil production increased 18,115 barrels per day, or 25 percent, in 1999 due primarily to increases in the United States. Domestic oil production increased 11,489 barrels per day, or 34 percent, primarily due to the Shell Offshore acquisition. Australian oil production increased 1,786 barrels per day, or 20 percent, over 1998 with additional full-year production from the Stag field. Egyptian oil production increased 3,840 barrels per day, or 14 percent, as a result of the price-driven dynamics of certain production sharing contracts and development activity.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Crude oil revenues totaled $336.8 million in 1998, a 28 percent decrease from 1997 due to lower average realized oil prices, which were partially offset by production increases. On a worldwide basis, average oil prices decreased 34 percent to $12.66 per barrel negatively impacting oil revenues by $158.9 million. Oil production increased 6,359 barrels per day (approximately 10 percent), in 1998 due to increases in Egypt and Australia. Australian oil production increased 4,421 barrels per day over 1997 with additional production from the Ampolex Group Transaction and initial sales from the Stag field. Egyptian oil production increased 8,539 barrels per day, or 44 percent, as a result of the price-driven dynamics of certain production sharing</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">21</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">contracts and to a lesser extent, drilling and development activity. U.S. oil production decreased by 6,571 barrels per day, or 16 percent, primarily due to marginal property sales in the first half of 1998 and natural reservoir depletion of mature fields.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Natural gas liquids revenues in 1999 increased 62 percent from 1998. Natural gas liquids production increased 1,055 barrels per day, or 37 percent and natural gas liquids prices increased by $1.48 per barrel, or 19 percent, due to improved market conditions. Natural gas liquids revenues decreased 30 percent in 1998. Natural gas liquids production increased 572 barrels per day, or 25 percent, while natural gas liquids prices declined by $6.14 per barrel, or 44 percent, due to deteriorating market conditions.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h2 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">Other Revenues and Operating Expenses</h2><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Gas gathering, processing and marketing revenues increased 33 percent to $155.6 million in 1999 from 1998. Higher gas prices in 1999 contributed to the increase. Gas gathering, processing and marketing costs increased by 34 percent to $153.4 million resulting in a slight decrease to 1999 margins. During 1998, gas gathering, processing and marketing revenues decreased 40 percent to $117.4 million. Slightly higher margins were realized in 1998 as compared to 1997.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Recurring DD&amp;A expense increased to $442.8 million in 1999 from $382.8 million in 1998. On an equivalent barrel basis, recurring full cost DD&amp;A expense decreased $.09 per boe, from $5.66 per boe in 1998 to $5.57 per boe in 1999. The decrease in the overall DD&amp;A rate was the result of substantial increases in United States production volumes during 1999 and the ceiling test write-down in 1998, which lowered the carrying amount of those properties being depleted. The Company&#39;s recurring DD&amp;A expense increased to $382.8 million in 1998 from $381.4 million in 1997. On an equivalent barrel basis, recurring full cost DD&amp;A expense decreased $.11 per boe, from $5.77 per boe in 1997 to $5.66 per boe in 1998.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Apache limits, on a country-by-country basis, the capitalized cost of oil and gas properties, net of accumulated DD&amp;A and deferred income taxes, to estimated future net cash flows from proved oil and gas reserves discounted at 10 percent, net of related tax effects, plus the lower of cost or fair value of unproved properties included in the costs being amortized. As a result of low oil and gas prices in the United States at December 31, 1998, Apache&#39;s capitalized costs of oil and gas properties exceeded the ceiling limitation and the Company reported a $243.2 million pre-tax ($158.1 million net of tax) non-cash write-down as additional DD&amp;A expense. No additional DD&amp;A expense was recorded during 1999 or 1997. Write-downs required by these rules do not impact cash flow from operating activities.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Apache&#39;s operating costs increased six percent in 1999 to $223.6 million from $211.6 in 1998. Lease operating expense (LOE), excluding severance taxes, increased from $182.9 million in 1998 to $191.2 million in 1999. On an equivalent barrel basis, LOE for 1999 averaged $2.56 per boe, a $.32 decline from $2.88 per boe in 1998. Domestic per unit costs were significantly reduced due to lower Southern region repairs, maintenance, power and fuel costs resulting from the sale of marginal properties partially offset by increases in the Offshore region due to workover costs associated with acquired properties located in the Gulf of Mexico from Petsec and Shell Offshore. Operating costs decreased nine percent to $211.6 million in 1998 from $231.4 million in 1997. LOE, excluding severance taxes, decreased from $190.8 million in 1997 to</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">$182.9 million in 1998. On an equivalent barrel basis, LOE for 1998 averaged $2.88 per boe, a $.19 decline from $3.07 per boe in 1997. Domestic per unit costs were significantly reduced from the sale of marginal North American properties, and by lower Southern region repairs and maintenance costs.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">G&amp;A expense increased $13.2 million, or 32 percent, from 1998 to 1999. The Company&#39;s overall infrastructure was enlarged to properly handle increased responsibilities associated with 1999 North American producing property acquisitions. On an equivalent barrel basis, G&amp;A expense increased to $.72 per boe in 1999 compared to $.64 per boe in 1998. G&amp;A expense increased $2.5 million, or seven percent from 1997 to 1998. On an equivalent barrel basis, G&amp;A expense increased to $.64 per boe in 1998 compared to $.62 per boe in 1997. The increase in G&amp;A expense was primarily the result of employee separation payments associated with the sale of marginal North American properties.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">22</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Net financing costs for 1999 increased $11.7 million, or 17 percent, from 1998 primarily due to higher interest expense and lower interest income, partially offset by higher capitalized interest. Gross interest expense increased $13.3 million resulting from higher average outstanding debt in 1999. The weighted average interest rate on outstanding debt increased to 7.5 percent at December 31, 1999 from 7.2 percent at December 31, 1998. The increase in capitalized interest is associated with Egyptian pipeline projects under construction. The decrease in interest income was due to a lower average cash balance during 1999. Net financing costs for 1998 decreased $1.8 million, or two percent, from 1997 primarily due to higher capitalized interest. Gross interest expense increased $14.6 million due to a slightly higher interest rate on average outstanding debt in 1998 compared to 1997 and higher imputed interest on advances from gas purchasers. This was offset by an increase in capitalized interest, interest income and lower amortization of deferred loan costs. The Company&#39;s weighted average interest rate on outstanding debt was 7.2 percent at December 31, 1998 compared to 7.1 percent at December 31, 1997.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h2 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">MARKET RISK</h2><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h2 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">Commodity Risk</h2><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Company&#39;s major market risk exposure is in the pricing applicable to its oil and gas production. Realized pricing is primarily driven by the prevailing worldwide price for crude oil and spot prices applicable to its United States and Canadian natural gas production. Historically, prices received for oil and gas production have been volatile and unpredictable and price volatility is expected to continue. Monthly oil price realizations ranged from a low of $10.09 per barrel to a high of $24.11 per barrel during 1999. Gas price realizations ranged from a monthly low of $1.60 per Mcf to a monthly high of $2.74 per Mcf during the same period.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Company periodically enters into hedging activities on a portion of its projected oil and natural gas production through a variety of financial and physical arrangements intended to support oil and natural gas prices at targeted levels and to manage its exposure to oil and gas price fluctuations. Apache may use futures contracts, swaps, options and fixed-price physical contracts to hedge its commodity prices. Realized gains or losses from the Company&#39;s price risk management activities are recognized in oil and gas production revenues when the associated production occurs. Apache does not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading purposes. In 1999, Apache recognized a net loss of $3.1 million from hedging activities that decreased oil and gas production revenues. The net loss in 1999 includes $6.7 million in derivatives losses and $3.6 million in gains from fixed-price physical gas contracts. Gains or losses on derivative contracts are expected to be offset by sales at the spot market price or to preserve the margin on existing physical gas contracts.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">At December 31,1999, the Company had open natural gas price swap positions with a positive fair value of $11.1 million. A 10 percent increase in natural gas prices would increase the fair value by $19.7 million. A 10 percent decrease in prices would decrease the fair value by</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">$19.7 million. The Company also had open oil price swap positions at December 31, 1999 with a negative fair value of $(9.4) million. A 10 percent increase in oil prices would decrease the fair value by $18.3 million. A 10 percent decrease in oil prices would increase the fair value by $18.3 million. Discount rates used in arriving at fair values range from 6.5 percent for 2000 to 7.3 percent for 2008.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">At December 31, 1999, the Company also had natural gas commodity collars with a fair value of $.8 million and oil commodity collars with a fair value of $(4.9) million. A 10 percent increase in oil and gas prices would change the fair values of the gas collars and the oil collars by</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">$(.9) million and $(5.2) million, respectively. A 10 percent decrease in oil and gas prices would change the fair values of the gas collars and the oil collars by $1.6 million and $3.9 million, respectively. The model used to arrive at the fair values for the commodity collars is based on the Black commodity pricing model. Changes in fair value, assuming 10 percent price changes, assume non-constant volatility with volatility based on prevailing market parameters at December 31,1999.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Notional volumes associated with the Company&#39;s derivative contracts are shown in Note 9 to the Company&#39;s consolidated financial statements.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">23</p><h2 style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">Interest Rate Risk</h2><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Company considers its interest rate risk exposure to be minimal as a result of fixing interest rates on approximately 83 percent of the Company&#39;s debt. Total debt at December 31, 1999, included $318.7 million of floating-rate debt. As a result, Apache&#39;s annual interest costs in 2000 will fluctuate based on short-term interest rates on approximately 17 percent of its total debt outstanding at December 31, 1999. The impact on annual cash flow of a 10 percent change in the floating rate (approximately 69 basis points) would be approximately $2.2 million. The Company did not have any open derivative contracts relating to interest rates at December 31, 1999.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h2 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">Foreign Currency Risk</h2><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Company&#39;s cash flow stream relating to certain international operations is based on the U.S. dollar equivalent of cash flows measured in foreign currencies. Australian gas production is sold under fixed-price Australian dollar contracts and over half the costs incurred are paid in Australian dollars. Revenue and disbursement transactions denominated in Australian dollars are converted to U.S. dollar equivalents based on the exchange rate on the transaction date. Reported cash flow relating to Canadian operations is based on cash flows measured in Canadian dollars converted to the U.S. dollar equivalent based on the average of the Canadian and U.S. dollar exchange rates for the period reported.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">Substantially all of the Company&#39;s international transactions, outside of Canada and Australia, are denominated in U.S. dollars.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Company&#39;s Polish and Australian subsidiaries have net financial assets that are denominated in a currency other than the functional reporting currency of the subsidiaries. A decrease in value of 10 percent in the Australian dollar and Polish zloty relative to the U.S. dollar from the year-end exchange rates would result in a foreign currency loss of approximately $.7 million, based on December 31, 1999 amounts. The Company considers its current risk exposure to exchange rate movements, based on net cash flows, to be immaterial. The Company did not have any open derivative contracts relating to foreign currencies at December 31, 1999.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h2 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">CASH FLOW, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES</h2><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h2 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">Capital Commitments</h2><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Apache&#39;s primary needs for cash are for exploration, development and acquisition of oil and gas properties, repayment of principal and interest on outstanding debt, payment of dividends, and capital obligations for affiliated ventures. The Company funds its exploration and development activities primarily through internally generated cash flows. Apache budgets capital expenditures based upon projected cash flows. The Company routinely adjusts its capital expenditures in response to changes in oil and natural gas prices and cash flow. The Company cannot accurately predict future oil and gas prices.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Capital Expenditures -- Apache&#39;s oil and gas capital expenditures over the last three years are summarized below:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">24</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Expenditures for exploration and development totaled $405.3 million in 1999 compared to $541.4 million in 1998. Apache&#39;s drilling program in 1999 added 64.1 MMboe of proved reserves (including revisions) and replaced 86 percent of production. In the United States, Apache completed 108 gross wells as producers out of 130 gross wells drilled during the year, compared with 183 gross producers out of 233 gross wells drilled in 1998. In Canada, Apache completed 32 gross wells as producers out of 49 gross wells drilled during the year, compared with 47 gross producers out of 66 gross wells drilled in 1998.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Internationally, the Company completed 50 gross producers out of 73 gross wells drilled in 1999, compared to 46 gross producers out of 84 gross wells in 1998. Successful international wells drilled in 1999 included 41 in Egypt and seven in Australia.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The total capital expenditures budget for 2000 is $597.5 million, including $384.9 million for North America. Estimated North American exploration and development expenditures include $56.4 million in the Southern region, $67.1 million in the Midcontinent region, $151.5 million in the Offshore region and $109.9 million in Canada. The Company has estimated its other international exploration and development expenditures in 2000, exclusive of facilities, to total approximately $212.6 million. Capital expenditures will be reviewed and possibly adjusted throughout the year in light of changing industry conditions.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">On February 1, 1999, the Company acquired oil and gas properties located in the Gulf of Mexico from Petsec for an adjusted purchase price of</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">$67.7 million. The Petsec transaction included estimated proved reserves of approximately 10.2 MMboe as of the acquisition date.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">On May 18, 1999, Apache acquired from Shell Offshore its interest in 22 producing fields and 16 undeveloped blocks located in the Gulf of Mexico. The Shell Offshore acquisition also included certain production-related assets and proprietary 2D and 3D seismic data covering approximately 1,000 blocks in the Gulf of Mexico. The purchase price was $687.7 million in cash and one million shares of Apache common stock (valued at $28.125 per share). The Shell Offshore acquisition included approximately 123.2 MMboe of proved reserves as of the acquisition date.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">On June 18, 1999, the Company acquired a 10 percent interest in the East Spar Joint Venture and an 8.4 percent interest in the Harriet Joint Venture, both located in the Carnarvon Basin (offshore Western Australia), from British-Borneo in exchange for $83.6 million cash and working interests in 11 leases in the Gulf of Mexico. The British-Borneo transaction included approximately 16.8 MMboe of proved reserves as of the acquisition date.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">On November 30, 1999, Apache acquired from Shell Canada producing properties and other assets for C$761 million (US$517.8 million). The producing properties consist of 150,400 net acres and comprise 20 fields with an average working interest of 55 percent and proved reserves of</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">87.2 MMboe as of the acquisition date. Apache also acquired 294,294 net acres of undeveloped leaseholdings, 100 percent interest in a gas processing plant with a potential throughput capacity of 160 million cubic feet (MMcf) per day, and 52,700 square miles of 2D seismic and 884 square miles of 3D seismic.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In 1999, the Company also completed tactical regional acquisitions for cash consideration totaling $17.7 million. These acquisitions added approximately 8.8 MMboe to the Company&#39;s proved reserves.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In January 2000, Apache completed the acquisition of producing properties in Western Oklahoma and the Texas Panhandle, formerly owned by a subsidiary of Repsol YPF, for approximately $119 million, plus assumed liabilities of approximately $30 million. The acquisition included estimated proved reserves of 206 Bcfe as of the acquisition date.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">In November 1998, the Company entered into agreements to acquire certain oil and gas interests and companies holding oil and gas interests in the Carnarvon Basin, offshore Western Australia, from subsidiaries of Novus for approximately $55 million. The interests have proved reserves of approximately</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">5.8 MMboe and daily production of 2,400 barrels of oil equivalent. They are within the Apache-operated Harriet Joint Venture (which includes production, processing and pipeline infrastructure associated with the Varanus Island hub), the Airlie Joint Venture (in which the Company held a prior interest and became operator) and three other</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">25</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">exploration permit areas. The transaction closed in two stages, in December 1998 for approximately $49 million and in January 1999 for approximately $6 million.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In 1998, the Company also completed tactical regional acquisitions for cash consideration totaling $19.4 million. These acquisitions added approximately 9.1 MMboe to the Company&#39;s reserves.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In November 1997, the Company acquired, in the Ampolex Group Transaction, all the capital stock of three companies owning interests in certain oil and gas properties (including 31.9 MMboe of proved oil and natural gas reserves) and production facilities offshore Western Australia for approximately $300 million pursuant to three agreements with subsidiaries of Mobil. The Ampolex Group Transaction acquisition, net of the sale of certain properties to Hardy Petroleum Limited (Hardy), increased the Company&#39;s interest to 47.5 percent from</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">22.5 percent in the Carnarvon Basin&#39;s Harriet area, which included the Varanus Island pipeline, processing and production complex and eight existing oil and gas fields. In addition, the Company&#39;s interest in the East Spar field, which produces through the Varanus Island facilities, increased to 45 percent from 20 percent. Apache operates both the Harriet and East Spar properties.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In conjunction with the closing of the Ampolex Group Transaction, in December 1997, the Company entered into an agreement under which Hardy agreed to purchase a 10 percent interest in the Company&#39;s East Spar gas field and related production facilities in Western Australia. The transaction closed in January 1998 with a total sales price of approximately $63 million in cash.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Debt and Interest Commitments -- At December 31, 1999, Apache had outstanding debt of $116 million under its global credit facility and an aggregate of $1.8 billion of other debt. This other debt included notes and debentures maturing in the years 2000 through 2096. Debt outstanding at December 31, 1999 of $1.9 billion was higher as compared to the $1.4 billion outstanding at December 31, 1998, due to the Company&#39;s significant acquisition activity during 1999. Even so, the Company&#39;s debt-to-capitalization ratio improved from 43.0 percent at December 31, 1998 to 41.4 percent at December 31, 1999. Interest payments on the Company&#39;s debt for 2000 are projected to be $162.0 million (using weighted average balances for floating rate obligations). Anticipated principal payments for 2000 total $6.2 million.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Dividend Payments -- Apache paid a total of $12.6 million in dividends during 1999 on its Series B Preferred Stock issued in August 1998 and its Series C Preferred Stock issued in May 1999. Common dividends paid during 1999 totaled $29.7 million, up nine percent from 1998, due to the increased number of common shares outstanding. The Company has paid cash dividends on its common stock for 132 consecutive quarters through December 31, 1999. The Company expects to continue payment of dividends at current levels on an annual basis. Future dividend payments will depend on the Company&#39;s level of earnings, financial requirements and other relevant factors.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h2 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">Capital Resources and Liquidity</h2><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Company&#39;s primary capital resources are net cash provided by operating activities, proceeds from financing activities and proceeds from sales of non-strategic assets.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities -- Apache&#39;s net cash provided by operating activities during 1999 totaled $638.2 million, an increase of 35 percent over the $471.5 million reported in 1998. This increase was due primarily to higher oil and gas production and prices in 1999. Net cash provided by operating activities during 1998 declined $252.3 million from 1997 due primarily to lower oil and gas prices and lower gas production in 1998, offset by the receipt of $71.8 million from a purchaser as an advance. The advance was for future natural gas deliveries over a ten-year period commencing in August 1998.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Long-Term Borrowings -- In March 1999, Apache Finance Pty Ltd, the Company&#39;s Australian finance subsidiary, issued $100 million principal amount, $99.3 million net of discount, of senior unsecured 7-percent notes due March 15, 2009. The notes are irrevocably and unconditionally guaranteed by Apache. The Company has the right to redeem the notes prior to maturity, under certain conditions related to changes in relevant tax laws. Also, upon certain changes in control, these notes would be subject to mandatory repurchase. The proceeds were used to reduce outstanding indebtedness under the Australian portion of the global credit facility.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">26</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In June 1999, the Company issued $150 million principal amount, $149.1 million net of discount, of senior unsecured 7.625-percent notes due July 1, 2019. The Company does not have the right to redeem the notes prior to maturity. Upon certain changes in control, these notes would be subject to mandatory repurchase.

The notes are irrevocably and unconditionally guaranteed by Apache. The Company has the right to redeem the notes prior to maturity, under certain conditions related to changes in relevant tax laws. Also, upon certain changes in control, these notes would be subject to mandatory repurchase. The proceeds were used to repay commercial paper issued to finance the Shell Canada acquisition.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Stock Transactions -- In May 1999, Apache issued 14,950,000 shares of Apache common stock for net proceeds of $444.3 million and 140,000 shares ($217 million) of Series C Preferred Stock in the form of seven million depositary shares each representing one-fiftieth (1/50th) of a share of Series C Preferred Stock for net proceeds of $210.5 million. The Series C Preferred Stock is not subject to a sinking fund or mandatory redemption. On May 15, 2002, each depositary share will automatically convert, subject to adjustments, into not more than one share and not less than 0.8197 of a share of Apache common stock, depending on the market price of Apache common stock at that time.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">At any time prior to May 15, 2002, holders of the depositary shares may elect to convert each of their shares, subject to adjustments, into not less than 0.8197 of a share of Apache common stock (5,737,900 common shares). Holders of the shares are entitled to receive cumulative cash dividends at an annual rate of $2.015 per depositary share when, and if, declared by Apache&#39;s board of directors.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The net proceeds from both offerings were used for general corporate purposes, including funding a portion of the purchase price for the Shell Offshore acquisition.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Asset Sales -- Apache received $110 million in 1999 and $131.1 million in 1998 from the sale of non-strategic oil and gas properties in a number of separate transactions. An additional $46.1 million in proceeds was received in 1999 due to Apache disposing of its holdings in the Ivory Coast by selling its wholly-owned subsidiary, Apache Cote d&#39;Ivoire Petroleum LDC to a consortium consisting of Mondoil Cote d&#39;Ivoire LLC and Saur Energie Cote d&#39;Ivoire. The proceeds were used to reduce debt.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Liquidity -- The Company had $13.2 million in cash and cash equivalents on hand at December 31, 1999, down from $14.5 million at December 31, 1998. Apache&#39;s ratio of current assets to current liabilities increased from .74:1 at December 31, 1998, to 1.02:1 at December 31,</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">1999.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Management believes that cash on hand, net cash generated from operations and unused committed borrowing capacity under its global credit facility will be adequate to satisfy the Company&#39;s financial obligations to meet future liquidity needs for at least the next two fiscal years. As of December 31, 1999, Apache&#39;s available borrowing capacity under its global credit facility was $884 million.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h2 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">IMPACT OF THE YEAR 2000 ISSUE</h2><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Company has not experienced any Year 2000 related computer failures or problems.

In order to achieve these objectives, we rigorously pursue operations to cut costs, identify production enhancement initiatives such as workovers and recompletions, and divest marginal and non-strategic properties.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h2 style="padding-left: 157pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Acquiring Properties to Which We Can Add Incremental Value</h2><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">We seek to purchase reserves at appropriate prices by generally avoiding auction processes where we are competing against other buyers. Our aim is to follow each acquisition with a cycle of reserve enhancement, property consolidation and cash flow acceleration, facilitating asset growth and debt reduction.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h2 style="padding-left: 187pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Investing in High-Potential Exploration Prospects</h2><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">We seek to concentrate our exploratory investments in a select number of international areas and to become the dominant operator in those regions. We believe that these investments, although higher-risk, offer the potential for significant reserve additions. Our international investments and exploration activities are a significant component of our long-term growth strategy. They complement our North American operations, which are more development oriented.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A critical component in implementing our three-pronged growth strategy is maintenance of significant financial flexibility.

Some of these include, but are not limited to, the market prices of oil and gas, economic and competitive conditions, inflation rates, legislative and regulatory changes, financial market conditions, political and economic uncertainties of foreign governments, future business decisions, and other uncertainties, all of which are difficult to predict.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved oil and gas reserves and in projecting future rates of production and the timing of development expenditures. The total amount or timing of actual future production may vary significantly from reserves and production estimates. The drilling of exploratory wells can involve significant risks, including those related to timing, success rates and cost overruns. Lease and rig availability, complex geology and other factors can affect these risks. Although Apache makes use of futures contracts, swaps, options and fixed-price physical contracts to mitigate risk, fluctuations in oil and gas prices, or a prolonged continuation of low prices, may substantially adversely affect the Company&#39;s financial position, results of operations and cash flows.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h2 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">ITEM 8.

The Company&#39;s North American exploration and production activities are divided into three U.S. operating regions (Offshore, Southern and Midcontinent) and a Canadian region. Approximately 73 percent of the Company&#39;s proved reserves are located in North America. Internationally, Apache has exploration and production interests in Egypt and offshore Western Australia, and exploration interests in Poland and offshore The People&#39;s Republic of China (China).</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Apache holds interests in many of its U.S., Canadian and international properties through operating subsidiaries, such as Apache Canada Ltd., DEK Energy Company (DEKALB, formerly known as DEKALB Energy Company), Apache Energy Limited (formerly known as Hadson Energy Limited), Apache International, Inc., and Apache Overseas, Inc.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Company&#39;s future financial condition and results of operations will depend upon prices received for its oil and natural gas production and the costs of finding, acquiring, developing and producing reserves. A substantial portion of the Company&#39;s production is sold under market- sensitive contracts. Prices for oil and natural gas are subject to fluctuations in response to changes in supply, market uncertainty and a variety of other factors beyond the Company&#39;s control. These factors include worldwide political instability (especially in the Middle East), the foreign supply of oil and natural gas, the price of foreign imports, the level of consumer demand, and the price and availability of alternative fuels.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">With natural gas accounting for 54 percent of Apache&#39;s 1999 production on an energy equivalent basis, the Company is affected more by fluctuations in natural gas prices than in oil prices.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Principles of Consolidation -- The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Apache and its subsidiaries after elimination of intercompany balances and transactions. The Company&#39;s interests in oil and gas exploration and production ventures and partnerships are proportionately consolidated. Apache&#39;s investment in Producers Energy Marketing LLC (ProEnergy) and a pipeline partnership in Western Australia are accounted for using the equity method for the periods of ownership.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Cash Equivalents -- The Company considers all highly liquid debt instruments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. These investments are carried at cost, which approximates market.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Inventories -- Inventories consist principally of tubular goods and production equipment, stated at the lower of weighted average cost or market, and oil produced but not sold, stated at current market value net of costs to sell.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Property and Equipment -- The Company uses the full cost method of accounting for its investment in oil and gas properties. Under this method, the Company capitalizes all acquisition, exploration and development costs incurred for the purpose of finding oil and gas reserves, including salaries, benefits and other internal costs directly attributable to these activities. Exclusive of field-level costs, Apache capitalized</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">$14.2 million, $12.2 million and $11.9 million of internal costs in 1999, 1998 and 1997, respectively. Costs associated with production and general corporate activities are expensed in the period incurred. Internal costs attributable to the management of the Company&#39;s producing properties, before recoveries from industry partners, totaled $24.4 million, $23.1 million and $22.5 million in 1999, 1998 and 1997, respectively, and are included in operating costs in the Company&#39;s statement of consolidated operations. Interest costs related to unproved properties and properties under development are also capitalized to oil and gas properties. Unless a significant portion of the Company&#39;s proved reserve quantities in a particular country are sold (greater than 25 percent), proceeds from the sale of oil and gas properties are accounted for as a reduction to capitalized costs, and gains and losses are not recognized.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">F-7</p><h2 style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 184pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">APACHE CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES</h2><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h2 style="padding-left: 122pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- (CONTINUED)</h2><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Apache computes the provision for recurring depreciation, depletion and amortization (DD&amp;A) of oil and gas properties on a quarterly basis using the unit-of-production method based upon production and estimates of proved reserve quantities. Unevaluated costs and related capitalized interest costs are excluded from the amortization base until the properties associated with these costs are evaluated. The amortizable base includes estimated future development costs and dismantlement, restoration and abandonment costs, net of estimated salvage values.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">These future costs are generally estimated by engineers employed by Apache.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Apache limits, on a country-by-country basis, the capitalized costs of proved oil and gas properties, net of accumulated DD&amp;A and deferred income taxes, to the estimated future net cash flows from proved oil and gas reserves discounted at 10 percent, net of related tax effects, plus the lower of cost or fair value of unproved properties included in the costs being amortized. If capitalized costs exceed this limit, the excess is charged to additional DD&amp;A expense. Included in the estimated future net cash flows are Canadian provincial tax credits expected to be realized beyond the date at which the legislation, under its provisions, could be repealed. To date, the Canadian provincial government has not indicated an intention to repeal this legislation.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">As a result of low oil and gas prices at December 31, 1998, Apache&#39;s capitalized costs of U.S. oil and gas properties exceeded the ceiling limitation and the Company recorded a $243.2 million pre-tax ($158.1 million net of tax) non-cash write-down in 1998. The write-down is reflected as additional DD&amp;A expense in the accompanying statement of consolidated operations. Given the volatility of oil and gas prices, it is reasonably possible that the Company&#39;s estimate of discounted future net cash flows from proved oil and gas reserves could change in the near term. If oil and gas prices decline significantly, even if only for a short period of time, it is possible that additional write-downs of oil and gas properties could occur in the future.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The costs of certain unevaluated leasehold acreage and wells being drilled are not being amortized. Costs not being amortized are periodically assessed for possible impairments or reductions in value. If a reduction in value has occurred, costs being amortized are increased or a charge is made against earnings for those international operations where a reserve base is not yet established.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Buildings, equipment and gas gathering, transmission and processing facilities are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which range from three to 20 years. Accumulated depreciation for these assets totaled $97.4 million and $70.0 million at December 31, 1999 and 1998, respectively.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Accounts Payable -- Included in accounts payable at December 31, 1999 and 1998, are liabilities of approximately $41.6 million and $24.0 million, respectively, representing the amount by which checks issued, but not presented to the Company&#39;s banks for collection, exceeded balances in applicable bank accounts.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Revenue Recognition -- Apache uses the sales method of accounting for natural gas revenues. Under this method, revenues are recognized based on actual volumes of gas sold to purchasers. The volumes of gas sold may differ from the volumes to which Apache is entitled based on its interests in the properties. Differences between volumes sold and entitled volumes create gas imbalances which are generally reflected as adjustments to reported proved gas reserves and future cash flows in the Company&#39;s supplemental oil and gas disclosures. Adjustments for gas imbalances totaled less than one percent of Apache&#39;s proved gas reserves at December 31, 1999. Revenue is deferred and a liability is recorded for those properties where the estimated remaining reserves will not be sufficient to enable the underproduced owner to recoup its entitled share through production.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities -- Apache periodically enters into commodity derivatives contracts and fixed-price physical contracts to manage its exposure to oil and gas price volatility. Commodity derivatives contracts, which are usually placed with major financial institutions that the Company believes are minimal credit risks, may take the form of futures contracts, swaps or options. The oil and gas reference prices upon which these commodity derivatives contracts are based reflect various market indices that have a high degree of historical correlation with actual prices received by the Company. The Company accounts for its</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">F-8</p><h2 style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 184pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">APACHE CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES</h2><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h2 style="padding-left: 122pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- (CONTINUED)</h2><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">commodity derivatives contracts using the hedge (or deferral) method of accounting. Under this method, realized gains and losses from the Company&#39;s price risk management activities are recognized in oil and gas production revenues when the associated production occurs and the resulting cash flows are reported as cash flows from operating activities. Gains and losses on commodity derivatives contracts that are closed before the hedged production occurs are deferred until the production month originally hedged. In the event of a loss of correlation between changes in oil and gas reference prices under a commodity derivatives contract and actual oil and gas prices, a gain or loss is recognized currently to the extent the commodity derivatives contract has not offset changes in actual oil and gas prices.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In June 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 133, &quot;Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities.&quot; SFAS No. 133 establishes accounting and reporting standards requiring that every derivative instrument (including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts) be recorded in the balance sheet as either an asset or liability measured at its fair value, and requires that changes in a derivative&#39;s fair value be recognized currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met. Special accounting for qualifying hedges allows a derivative&#39;s gains and losses to offset related results on the hedged item in the statement of consolidated operations, and requires that a company formally document, designate, and assess the effectiveness of transactions that receive hedge accounting treatment. SFAS No. 133, as amended, is required to be adopted on January 1, 2001, although earlier adoption is permitted. The Company is analyzing the effects of SFAS No. 133, but has not yet quantified the impact on its financial statements or determined the timing or method of adoption. Management does not believe that the adoption of SFAS No. 133 will have a material impact on the Company&#39;s financial condition or results of operations.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Income Taxes -- The Company follows the liability method of accounting for income taxes under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences of (i) temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements and (ii) operating loss and tax credit carryforwards for tax purposes. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, based upon management&#39;s estimates, it is more likely than not that a portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized in a future period.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Foreign Currency Translation -- The U.S. dollar is considered the functional currency for each of the Company&#39;s international operations, except for its Canadian subsidiary whose functional currency is the Canadian dollar. Translation adjustments resulting from translating the Canadian subsidiary&#39;s foreign currency financial statements into U.S. dollar equivalents are reported separately and accumulated in other comprehensive income. For other international operations, transaction gains and losses are recognized in net income.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Net Income (Loss) Per Common Share -- Basic and diluted net income (loss) per common share have been computed in accordance with SFAS No. 128, &quot;Earnings per Share.&quot; Basic net income (loss) per common share is computed by dividing income (loss) attributable to common stock by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted net income per common share reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised or converted into common stock. Diluted net loss per common share does not reflect dilution from potential common shares, because to do so would be antidilutive. Calculations of basic and diluted net income (loss) per common share are illustrated in Note 7.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Stock-Based Compensation -- The Company accounts for employee stock-based compensation using the intrinsic value method prescribed by Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 25, &quot;Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees&quot; and related interpretations. Nonemployee stock-based compensation is accounted for using the fair value method in accordance with SFAS No. 123, &quot;Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation.&quot;</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">F-9</p><h2 style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 184pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">APACHE CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES</h2><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h2 style="padding-left: 122pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- (CONTINUED)</h2><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Use of Estimates -- The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Significant estimates with regard to these financial statements include the estimate of proved oil and gas reserve quantities and the related present value of estimated future net cash flows therefrom (see supplemental oil and gas disclosures).</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p></li><li style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: -9pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">ACQUISITIONS AND DIVESTITURES</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h2 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">Acquisitions</h2><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">On February 1, 1999, the Company acquired oil and gas properties located in the Gulf of Mexico from Petsec Energy Inc.

The interests have estimated proved reserves of approximately 5.8 MMboe and daily production of 2,400 barrels of oil equivalent. They are within the Apache-operated Harriet Joint Venture (which includes production, processing and pipeline infrastructure associated with the Varanus Island hub), the Airlie Joint Venture (in which the Company held a prior interest and became operator) and three other exploration permit areas. The transaction closed in two stages, in December 1998 (approximately $49 million) and in January 1999 (approximately $6 million). Under the terms of an agreement with Novus, the Company may be required to make additional payments to Novus based on proved and probable recoverable oil and condensate reserves, as determined by independent engineers, on a defined geological structure in the Gipsy-Rose-Lee area, offshore Western Australia. If required, such payments would be calculated using $2.50 for each barrel of proved and $1.25 for each barrel of probable oil and condensate reserves.

The global credit facility consists of three separate bank facilities: a $700 million facility in the United States; a $175 million facility in Australia; and a $125 million facility in Canada. The global credit facility enables Apache to draw on the entire $1 billion facility without restrictions tied to periodic revaluation of the Company&#39;s oil and gas reserves. As of December 31, 1999, Apache&#39;s available borrowing capacity under the global credit facility was $884 million. Under the financial covenants of the global credit facility, the Company must (i) maintain a consolidated tangible net worth, as defined, of at least $1.2 billion as of December 31, 1999, which is adjusted for subsequent earnings, and (ii) maintain a ratio of debt to capitalization of not greater than 60 percent at the end of any fiscal quarter.

In June 1997, Apache expanded its commercial paper program to $700 million from $300 million to provide access to additional low-cost, short- term funds. Since its inception in January 1997, the Company&#39;s commercial paper program has been rated A-2, Prime-2 and D-1- (D-One-Minus) by Standard &amp; Poor&#39;s, Moody&#39;s and Duff and Phelps, respectively. As of December 31, 1999, no amounts were outstanding under Apache&#39;s commercial paper program.

Each Right entitles the registered holder to purchase from the Company one ten- thousandth (1/10,000) of a share of Series A Preferred Stock at a price of $100 per one ten-thousandth of a share, subject to adjustment. The Rights are exercisable 10 calendar days following a public announcement that certain persons or groups have acquired 20 percent or more of the outstanding shares of Apache common stock or 10 business days following commencement of an offer for 30 percent or more of the outstanding shares of Apache common stock. In addition, if a person or group becomes the beneficial owner of 20 percent or more of Apache&#39;s outstanding common stock (flip in event), each Right will become exercisable for shares of Apache&#39;s common stock at 50 percent of the then market price of the common stock. If a 20 percent shareholder of Apache acquires Apache, by merger or otherwise, in a transaction where Apache does not survive or in which Apache&#39;s common stock is changed or exchanged (flip over event), the Rights become exercisable for shares of the common stock of the company acquiring Apache at 50 percent of the then market price for Apache common stock. Any Rights that are or were beneficially owned by a person who has acquired 20 percent or more of the outstanding shares of Apache common stock and who engages in certain transactions or realizes the benefits of certain transactions with the Company will become void. The Company may redeem the Rights at $.01 per Right at any time until 10 business days after public announcement of a flip in event. The Rights will expire on January 31, 2006, unless earlier redeemed by the Company. Unless the Rights have been previously redeemed, all shares of Apache common stock issued by the Company after January 31, 1996 will include Rights. Unless and until the Rights become exercisable, they will be transferred with and only with the shares of Apache common stock.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Series B Preferred Stock -- In August 1998, Apache issued 100,000 shares ($100 million) of Series B Preferred Stock in the form of one million depositary shares, each representing one-tenth (1/10) of a share of Series B Preferred Stock, for net proceeds of $98.4 million. The Series B Preferred Stock has no stated maturity, is not subject to a sinking fund and is not convertible into Apache common stock or any other securities of the Company.

The fair values of all other notes and debentures are based on the quoted market prices. The carrying amount of the bank debt, commercial paper and money market lines of credit approximated fair value because the interest rates are variable and reflective of market rates.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Commodity Price Hedges -- Apache periodically enters into commodity derivative contracts and fixed-price physical contracts to manage its exposure to oil and gas price volatility. Commodity derivatives contracts, which are usually placed with major financial institutions that the Company believes are minimal credit risks, may take the form of futures contracts, swaps or options. The derivative contracts call for Apache to receive, or make, payments based upon the differential between a fixed and a variable commodity price as specified in the contract. As a result of these activities, Apache recognized hedging losses of $6.7 million in 1999 and hedging gains of $1.3 million and $14.5 million in 1998 and 1997, respectively. The hedging gains and losses are included in oil and gas production revenues in the statement of consolidated operations.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The following table and note thereto cover the Company&#39;s pricing and notional volumes on open commodity derivative contracts as of December 31, 1999:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 2pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="193" height="3" alt="image" src="NYSE_APA_2000/Image_013.png"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">(1) The Company has various contracts to supply gas at fixed prices. In order to lock in a margin on a portion of the volumes, the Company is a fixed price payor on swap transactions. The average physical contract price ranges from $2.32 in 2000 to $2.56 in 2008. The fair value of these hedges was $11.1 million at December 31, 1999, all of which is related to the arrangements discussed in Note 6.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">F-25</p><h2 style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 184pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">APACHE CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES</h2><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h2 style="padding-left: 122pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- (CONTINUED)</h2><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p></li><li style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Litigation -- The Company is involved in litigation and is subject to governmental and regulatory controls arising in the ordinary course of business.

These laws and regulations may, among other things, impose liability on the lessee under an oil and gas lease for the cost of pollution clean-up resulting from operations and subject the lessee to liability for pollution damages. Apache maintains insurance coverage, which it believes, is customary in the industry, although it is not fully insured against all environmental risks.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">As part of the Company&#39;s due diligence review for acquisitions, Apache conducts an extensive environmental evaluation of purchased properties. Depending on the extent of an identified environmental problem, the Company may exclude a property from the acquisition, require the seller to remediate the property to Apache&#39;s satisfaction, or agree to assume liability for remediation of the property. As of December 31, 1999, Apache had a reserve for environmental remediation of approximately $7.7 million. The Company is not aware of any environmental claims existing as of December 31, 1999, which have not been provided for or would otherwise have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations. There can be no assurance, however, that current regulatory requirements will not change, or past non-compliance with environmental laws will not be discovered on the Company&#39;s properties.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">International Commitments -- The Company, through its subsidiaries, has acquired or has been conditionally or unconditionally granted exploration rights in Australia, Egypt, China and Poland. In order to comply with the contracts and agreements granting these rights, the Company, through various wholly-owned subsidiaries, is committed to expend approximately $95 million through 2003.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Retirement and Deferred Compensation Plans -- The Company provides a 401(k) savings plan for employees which allows participating employees to elect to contribute up to 12 percent of their salaries, with Apache making matching contributions up to a maximum of six percent of each employee&#39;s salary. In addition, the Company annually contributes six percent of each participating employee&#39;s compensation, as defined, to a money purchase retirement plan. The 401(k) plan and the money purchase retirement plan are subject to certain annually-adjusted, government-mandated restrictions which limit the amount of each employee&#39;s contributions.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">For certain eligible employees, the Company also provides a non-qualified retirement/savings plan which allows the deferral of up to 50 percent of each such employee&#39;s salary, and which accepts employee contributions and the Company&#39;s matching contributions in excess of the above-referenced restrictions on the 401(k) savings plan and money purchase retirement plan. Additionally, Apache Energy Limited and Apache Canada Ltd. maintain separate retirement plans, as required under the laws of Australia and Canada, respectively.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Vesting in the Company&#39;s contributions to the 401(k) savings plan, the money purchase retirement plan and the non-qualified retirement/savings plan occurs at the rate of 20 percent per year. Total expenses under all plans were $7.8 million, $7.3 million and $6.3 million for 1999, 1998 and 1997, respectively. The unfunded liability for all plans has been accrued in the consolidated balance sheet.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">China -- On May 28, 1999, Apache China Corporation LDC (Apache China, an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of the Company) sent a notice of default to XCL-China, Ltd.

Prior to the expiration of the cure period, XCL-China and XCL, Ltd. filed petitions initiating arbitration proceedings against Apache China. The actions seek to disallow approximately $17 million in costs expended by Apache China related to developing the Zhao Dong Block, including the $10 million in costs billed by Apache China to XCL-China that have not been paid. In addition, XCL-China has advised Apache China of XCL-China&#39;s intent to seek the removal of Apache China as operator of the Block. Apache China has denied the allegations made by XCL-China in its petition and is vigorously contesting them. On November 30, 1999 the arbitration proceedings were stayed in connection with the bankruptcy proceeding described below.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">On June 25, 1999, Apache China filed a petition in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Opelousas, Louisiana, to place XCL-China into involuntary bankruptcy under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code on account of XCL-China&#39;s failure to pay its share of costs related to development of the Zhao Dong Block. On December 21, 1999, the holders of XCL, Ltd.&#39;s senior secured notes, acting through their Trustee, exercised their remedial rights under their indenture and removed the existing Board of Directors of XCL-China, electing a new Board. The new Board of Directors of XCL-China voted to withdraw XCL-China&#39;s opposition to Apache China&#39;s Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition filed against XCL-China and on December 22, 1999 obtained an order of the Court converting the proceeding into a voluntary Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceeding.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Apache China has entered into negotiations with the Chinese authorities concerning the terms and conditions of the development of the Zhao Dong Block including, among other things the portion of XCL-China&#39;s future development costs to be paid by the Chinese. Apache China is prepared to move forward as soon as these negotiations are satisfactorily concluded.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Lease Commitments -- The Company has leases for buildings, facilities and equipment with varying expiration dates through 2007. Net rental expense was $11.5 million, $8.1 million and $5.8 million for 1999, 1998 and 1997, respectively.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">As of December 31, 1999, minimum rental commitments under long-term operating leases, net of sublease rentals, and long-term pipeline transportation commitments, ranging from one to 24 years, are as follows:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Partnership in Western Australia -- Apache is a partner in a partnership formed to construct and operate a 62-mile pipeline from Varanus Island to onshore facilities in Western Australia.

ProEnergy, renamed Cinergy Marketing and Trading LLC, will continue to market Apache&#39;s North American natural gas production for 10 years, with an option to terminate after six years, under an amended and restated gas purchase agreement effective July 1, 1998. During this period, Apache is generally obligated to deliver most of its North American gas production to Cinergy and, under certain circumstances, reimburse Cinergy if certain gas throughput thresholds are not met. Accordingly, Apache recorded a deferred gain of $20.0 million, subject to adjustment, on the sale of ProEnergy that is being amortized over six years.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Related Parties -- F.H. Merelli, a member of the Company&#39;s board of directors since July 1997, is chairman, president and chief executive officer of Key Production Company, Inc. (Key). In the normal course of business, Key paid to Apache during 1999 approximately $3.0 million for Key&#39;s proportionate share of drilling and workover costs, mineral interests and routine expenses relating to 380 oil and gas wells in which Key owns interests and for which Apache is the operator. Key received approximately $6.3 million in 1999 for its proportionate share of revenues from such interests, of which approximately $4.2 million was paid directly to Key by Apache or related entities.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Major Purchasers -- In 1999, purchases by Cinergy and the Egyptian General Petroleum Corporation (EGPC) accounted for 29 percent and 21 percent of the Company&#39;s oil and gas production revenues, respectively. In 1998, purchases by Cinergy/ProEnergy and EGPC accounted for 38 percent and 17 percent of the Company&#39;s oil and gas production revenues, respectively. In 1997, purchases by ProEnergy and EGPC accounted for 40 percent and 13 percent of the Company&#39;s oil and gas production revenues.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Concentration of Credit Risk -- The Company&#39;s revenues are derived principally from uncollateralized sales to customers in the oil and gas industry; therefore, customers may be similarly affected by changes in economic and other conditions within the industry. Apache has not experienced significant credit losses on such sales. Sales of natural gas by Apache to Cinergy are similarly uncollateralized.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">F-28</p><h2 style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 184pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">APACHE CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES</h2><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h2 style="padding-left: 122pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- (CONTINUED)</h2><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p></li><li style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">BUSINESS SEGMENT INFORMATION</p></li></ol><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Apache has five reportable segments which are primarily in the business of natural gas and crude oil exploration and production.

Estimates of future liabilities and receivables applicable to oil and gas commodity hedges are reflected in future cash flows from proved reserves with such estimates based on prices in effect as of the date of the reserve report. Fluctuations are largely due to supply and demand perceptions for natural gas and volatility in oil prices.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Under the full cost accounting rules of the SEC, the Company reviews the carrying value of its proved oil and gas properties each quarter on a country-by-country basis. Under these rules, capitalized costs of proved oil and gas properties, net of accumulated DD&amp;A and deferred income taxes, may not exceed the present value of estimated future net cash flows from proved oil and gas reserves, discounted at 10 percent, plus the lower of cost or fair value of unproved properties included in the costs being amortized, net of related tax effects. These rules generally require pricing future oil and gas production at the unescalated oil and gas prices at the end of each fiscal quarter and require a write-down if the &quot;ceiling&quot; is exceeded. Given the volatility of oil and gas prices, it is reasonably possible that the Company&#39;s estimate of discounted future net cash flows from proved oil and gas reserves could change in the near term. If oil and gas prices decline significantly, even if only for a short period of time, it is possible that write-downs of oil and gas properties could occur in the future.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">F-36</p><h2 style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 184pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">APACHE CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES</h2><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h2 style="padding-left: 174pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">SUPPLEMENTAL QUARTERLY FINANCIAL DATA</h2><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: center;">(UNAUDITED)</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 2pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="194" height="3" alt="image" src="NYSE_APA_2000/Image_017.png"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><ol id="l9"><li style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">The sum of the individual quarterly net income (loss) per common share amounts may not agree with year-to-date net income (loss) per common share as each quarterly computation is based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during that period.

Shares of Stock which may be issued upon exercise of Options shall be applied to reduce the maximum number of shares of Stock remaining available for use under the Plan.
