We are clear in our approach to the market: we lead with network products and services and enable a targeted set of related services focused on cybersecurity and other technology solutions such as data analytics and managed services. We are encouraged by the interest enterprise customers are showing in our recently launched network, cloud, data analytics and security offerings. And</p><p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 135%;text-align: left;">consumer customers are responding positively to our higher broadband speeds and simplified product offers.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 135%;text-align: left;">Our network is our principal asset, key differentiator and source of attractive growth opportunities. We operate a 265,000-route-mile U.S. fiber network and a 360,000- route-mile international transport network connecting millions of businesses and consumers around the world.</p><p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 135%;text-align: left;">This robust network positions us well to capitalize on the remarkable increase in data traffic driven by video streaming, new applications and services related to the Internet of Things (IoT), virtual and augmented reality and 5G wireless technology. As the digital world continues to expand, the potential of our network to deliver value and opportunity to our stakeholders expands as well.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 135%;text-align: left;">However, our success requires more than simply enabling a powerful network. To meet our rapidly evolving competitive environment, we are also focused on significantly improving our customer experience and driving higher levels of efficiency through automation, simplification, organizational change and operational improvement. Taken together, our network-first approach, supplemented with targeted, value-added services, a differentiated customer experience and increasing levels of</p><p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 135%;text-align: left;">efficiency will drive us toward our goal of being the world’s best, most reliable network services provider.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h2 style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 135%;text-align: left;">LEVEL 3 ACQUISITION: POSITIONING OURSELVES AS A GLOBAL ENTERPRISE COMMUNICATIONS PROVIDER</h2><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 135%;text-align: left;">In October 2016 we announced the pending acquisition of Level 3, which we believe is a transformational transaction for our company. Level 3 is expected to add approximately 200,000 route miles of fiber to our network, making us the second largest domestic communications provider serving global enterprise customers in terms of enterprise revenues. CenturyLink will be a business of impressive scale, reach and capabilities, with improved opportunities for revenue growth. We are working diligently to secure the necessary regulatory approvals to close the transaction by the end of third quarter 2017.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 135%;text-align: left;">With Level 3, we also expect to gain 64,000 route miles of fiber in 350 metropolitan areas and 33,000 subsea route miles of fiber connecting multiple continents. On- net buildings are expected to increase by 75 percent,</p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 135%;text-align: left;">to approximately 75,000 buildings, improving the cost- effectiveness of acquiring new customers and increasing business with our existing customers, particularly in Latin America and Europe.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 135%;text-align: left;">More than 75 percent of the combined company’s core revenue is expected to come from business customers, and 65 percent of core revenue will be from strategic services. The two companies’ complementary service portfolios create significant new revenue potential across the combined customer base. For example, Level 3 offers best-in-class</p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 135%;text-align: left;">VoIP access and SIP trunking services, according to Frost &amp; Sullivan, while CenturyLink offers leading software-defined wide area network service (SD-WAN) and hybrid IT offerings that will provide growth opportunities for both of our customer bases.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s3" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 330pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">2016 SUMMARY ANNUAL REPORT AND 2017 ANNUAL MEETING DOCUMENTS <b>1</b></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="383" height="259" alt="image" src="NYSE_CTL_2016/Image_004.jpg"/></span></p><h1 style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">To Our Shareholders <span class="s4">continued</span></h1><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h3 style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 306pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Glen F. Post, III <span class="s5">Chief Executive Officer and President</span></h3><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 135%;text-align: left;">We expect the increased scale of the combined company to generate annual run-rate cash synergies of approximately</p><p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 135%;text-align: left;">$975 million when fully realized. In addition, the tax benefits of Level 3’s prior net operating losses should substantially reduce the combined company’s net cash tax expense for the next several years. We estimate the transaction will be free cash flow accretive in the first year. This improved free cash flow will enhance the combined company’s financial flexibility and dividend coverage.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 135%;text-align: left;">The Level 3 acquisition was not the only significant transaction we announced in 2016. In keeping with our network-first capital investment focus, we also announced the sale of our colocation business to a consortium led by BC Partners and Medina Capital Advisors. Although CenturyLink will no longer own the physical data centers, we remain a minority investor in this business and will partner with the buyer for delivery</p><p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 135%;text-align: left;">of colocation services to our customers. This transaction is nearing close as we go to press with this year’s report. We plan to use a portion of the net proceeds of this transaction to partially fund the Level 3 acquisition.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h2 style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 135%;text-align: left;">INVESTING IN NETWORK BANDWIDTH, CAPABILITIES AND CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE</h2><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 135%;text-align: left;">In 2016, we invested nearly $3 billion in increased bandwidth and innovative network and systems capabilities to help deliver a better customer experience. These investments are core to our business as we enhance our overall network speed, reach and reliability, and drive more automation into our service delivery platform.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 18pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 135%;text-align: left;">We are focused on enabling the highest speed for customers that technology and market economics allow.</p><p style="padding-left: 18pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 135%;text-align: left;">We know our customers will need increasingly higher speeds and greater capacity, and we want to be the provider they choose. Our approach is straightforward: we deploy fiber wherever possible and use alternative broadband technologies when fiber deployment is uneconomic.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 18pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 135%;text-align: left;">In 2016, we increased addressable units receiving broadband speeds of 100 Mbps and higher and 1 Gbps or more by</p><p style="padding-left: 18pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 135%;text-align: left;">31 percent and 53 percent, respectively. In August 2016, we set aggressive new targets in our multi-year broadband- deployment investment plan. Under this plan, we expect</p><p style="padding-left: 18pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 135%;text-align: left;">to have 65 to 70 percent of addressable units in our top 25 markets capable of broadband speeds of 100 Mbps and higher, and 15 to 20 percent capable of 1 Gbps or more by year-end 2019.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 18pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 135%;text-align: left;">In addition to these improved connectivity options, in June of last year we introduced CenturyLink<span class="s6">® </span>SD-WAN, a fully- managed, software-defined wide area network (SD-WAN) solution, which has generated strong customer interest. Also, in keeping with our efforts to invest principally in our network capabilities, we have refocused our traditional linear Prism<span class="s6">® </span>TV offering to a less capital-intensive Over the Top (OTT) delivery model, which we expect to commercially launch by mid-2017.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 18pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 135%;text-align: left;">We are supplementing these enhanced network offerings with an improved customer experience. Our vision of</p><p style="padding-left: 18pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">an improved experience is anchored in the ongoing</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="792" height="39" alt="image" src="NYSE_CTL_2016/Image_005.png"/></span></p><p class="s3" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 37pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><b>2 </b>C<span class="s7">ENTURY</span>L<span class="s7">INK</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="792" height="116" alt="image" src="NYSE_CTL_2016/Image_006.png"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 135%;text-align: left;">simplification of our product and service offerings. We are actively grooming our product portfolio to identify and build service excellence around those core products and</p><p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 135%;text-align: left;">services that are most critical to our customers. This makes our customer interactions simpler and drives efficiency in our business. On top of this simplified product catalog, we are also driving higher levels of digitization, automation and customer self-service into our platform.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 135%;text-align: left;">Creating the customer experience we envision is a multi- year process, but we are making progress toward our goal.</p><p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 135%;text-align: left;">In addition to simplifying the range of offerings across key products such as Ethernet and consumer broadband, during 2016 we also automated service delivery of our core Ethernet product and accelerated, by as much as 30 percent, the provisioning timelines for key products and services such as Fiber+ and local Ethernet. There remains much work ahead to enable the simplified, automated customer experience we envision, but we have a clear view and made good progress toward our goal in 2016.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h2 style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">IMPROVING PERFORMANCE</h2><p style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 135%;text-align: left;">As excited as we are about our sharpened network-first focus, we also have to acknowledge that in certain areas our 2016 results fell short of our expectations. Progress is rarely linear in a business changing as rapidly as ours, and 2016 saw disappointing results in our managed services and colocation businesses, as well as our consumer broadband business. We have made a number of organizational and go- to-market changes to address these results and, while we still need to see sustained performance, we are encouraged by improvements in certain key trends toward the end of the year.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 135%;text-align: left;">Our consumer business saw higher-than-expected broadband churn as we shifted our marketing emphasis to higher-value consumer bundles and faced more intense competition. To address this trend, we are improving the speeds in our network and intensifying our efforts to improve the customer experience. As noted above, our broadband investment plan is enabling 100 Mbps to</p><p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 135%;text-align: left;">1 Gbps speeds to an increasingly large percentage of our customers. We are supplementing this enhanced speed with simplified pricing plans and an OTT video offering.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 18pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 135%;text-align: left;">Our OTT product has a minimum bandwidth requirement of only 10 Mbps, meaning a better video product will be available to more customers at a better price point than our traditional Prism<span class="s6">® </span>TV service. We were pleased to see</p><p style="padding-left: 18pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 135%;text-align: left;">improvements begin to emerge in our consumer broadband units trends as we exited 2016.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 18pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 135%;text-align: left;">Uncertainty surrounding the sale of our data centers negatively impacted our managed services business in 2016, particularly managed hosting services. We still</p><p style="padding-left: 18pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 135%;text-align: left;">believe in the value of these services to our customers, and we are becoming much more disciplined with the hosting services we offer. We are also increasingly partnering with at-scale infrastructure providers to enable delivery of a broader range of services with lower capital requirements.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 18pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 135%;text-align: left;">Our enterprise customers are looking for more than connectivity. They also want professional services to help them manage their network, hosting and cloud-based services. And they want targeted IT consulting, analytics, security and data intelligence services to help drive efficiencies and grow their businesses. While we have not performed as we expected across the managed services space, we believe we have a role to play in delivering those services to our customers. 2016 has taught us that to be successful in this area we must be very focused on enabling specifically defined capabilities, very disciplined about the products and services we take to market and broad-minded about using partners and alliances to enable capital-efficient, infrastructure-based solutions. This is</p><p style="padding-left: 18pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 135%;text-align: left;">the focus of our managed services and infrastructure businesses for 2017.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h2 style="padding-left: 18pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 135%;text-align: left;">EVOLVING OUR ORGANIZATION AND ALIGNING COSTS WITH REVENUES</h2><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 18pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 135%;text-align: left;">Finally, we understand our success will require us to do more than deliver a robust set of network and targeted value-added services. The changing and competitive environment in which we operate also requires that we continue to enhance our organization and align our cost structure with our revenues. 2016 saw a great deal of change on these fronts as well.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s3" style="padding-left: 321pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">2016 SUMMARY ANNUAL REPORT AND 2017 ANNUAL MEETING DOCUMENTS <b>3</b></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="780" height="1032" alt="image" src="NYSE_CTL_2016/Image_007.jpg"/></span></p><h1 style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 48pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">To Our Shareholders <span class="s4">continued</span></h1><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 48pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 135%;text-align: left;">In February 2016, we added new sales and marketing leaders to our team, and we began to refine our go-to- market strategies to bring greater focus on customer needs and buying behavior in the business market. Later in 2016 we made additional leadership changes in our consumer business, and in January 2017 we aligned our customer- facing organizations into three separate business units: Enterprise, Consumer and IT &amp; Managed Services. We expect this market-facing alignment will improve focus on</p><p style="padding-left: 48pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">specific business priorities and drive revenue and profitability.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 48pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 135%;text-align: left;">Across all of these business units, we plan to strengthen our local operating model to enable faster decision-making, increased accountability and improved customer service.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 48pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 135%;text-align: left;">From a cost reduction point of view, we expect to see improved efficiencies as we continue to consolidate and improve our platforms and simplify our product offerings. We implemented several cost-containment initiatives in the second half of 2016, including a seven to eight percent</p><p style="padding-left: 48pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 135%;text-align: left;">reduction in employee-related expenses. And as mentioned earlier, we expect the Level 3 transaction to be a significant source for both operating and capital efficiencies. This is difficult and unglamorous work, but critical to our future success in the marketplace.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h2 style="padding-left: 48pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">REALIZING OUR POTENTIAL</h2><p style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 48pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 135%;text-align: left;">Our purpose as a company is to connect our customers to the power of the digital world. This is an important and</p><p style="padding-left: 48pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 135%;text-align: left;">exciting role. We consider ourselves fortunate to be one of the few companies with the assets and capabilities required to provide the connectivity so many families and businesses will need in the future. We believe delivery on this purpose will create real and sustained value to our customers, shareholders and employees.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 135%;text-align: left;">While there is much work to do, we are confident in our vision and believe we are making solid progress toward realizing our growth potential. Through both acquisition and investment, we are strengthening the quality, reliability and capacity of our network — our most unique asset. And we are enhancing our network capability with differentiated customer experiences and a focused set of services and solutions that deliver value beyond mere connectivity.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 135%;text-align: left;">We enter 2017 with improving performance trends, a focus on the execution of our business plan and excitement about the potential of the pending Level 3 acquisition to further improve our scale, scope, efficiency and growth prospects. We will continue to work diligently in the year ahead to deliver the critical services our customers require, to improve the efficiency in our business and to capitalize on what we believe is a unique opportunity to drive long-term shareholder value.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Glen F.
