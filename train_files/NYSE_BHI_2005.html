36pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 128%;text-align: left;">I am pleased to report that 2005 was an outstanding year for Baker Hughes with record revenues and profits and exceptional growth in the price of our common stock. As worldwide energy pro- duction capacity barely kept pace with growing demand, drilling and production activity continued to increase. With our Strategic Framework in place, Baker Hughes took advantage of opportunities in this active market. We built on our strength in North America while accelerat- ing our growth in the Eastern Hemi- sphere. Our divisions continued to focus on Best-in-Class products and services, and they introduced new, differentiating technologies that created value for cus- tomers and contributed to strong financial results for the year.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s38" style="padding-left: 36pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Our People Delivered Results</p><p class="s37" style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 36pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 128%;text-align: left;">Our more than 29,000 Baker Hughes employees deserve the credit for helping deliver such outstanding results in 2005. Through dedication and hard work, our people achieved record productivity and maintained high standards of safety, qual- ity and service. Our employees made the most of limited resources, and many of them worked extra hours and spent long rotations away from home. I thank our employees for their significant contribu- tions during the year.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s38" style="padding-left: 36pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Record Performance</p><p class="s37" style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 36pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 128%;text-align: justify;">Baker Hughes achieved record revenues and profits, as growth exceeded increases in the rig count. In last year’s report,</p><p class="s37" style="padding-left: 36pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 128%;text-align: left;">we projected that drilling activity would increase by 9–11% in 2005. In fact,</p><p class="s37" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 128%;text-align: left;">Baker Hughes revenues grew 18% and earnings per diluted share were up 63%, as the average worldwide active rig count increased by 15%.</p><p class="s37" style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 128%;text-align: left;">Revenues were $7.2 billion compared to $6.1 billion in 2004. Income from con- tinuing operations was $874 million in 2005, up 66% from $525 million in 2004. Our oilfield pre-tax operating margin, excluding the WesternGeco joint venture, reached an all time high of 20% in 2005, up from 17% in the prior year, the result of higher demand, greater pro- ductivity and stronger pricing.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s38" style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Two Segments, Regional Alignment</p><p class="s37" style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 128%;text-align: justify;">During 2005, two positive steps aligned our organization to pursue growth opportunities.</p><p class="s37" style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 128%;text-align: left;">First, we created two business segments by forming the Drilling and Evaluation segment (comprised of Hughes Christensen, INTEQ, Baker Atlas and Baker Hughes Drilling Fluids) and the Comple- tion and Production segment (comprised of Baker Oil Tools, Centrilift, Baker Petro- lite and our new Production Optimization business unit).</p><p class="s37" style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 128%;text-align: left;">These two segments are organized around customer needs during distinct phases of oil and gas development.</p><p class="s37" style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 128%;text-align: left;">Within each segment, our divisions will focus on cross-divisional opportunities, sharpen their focus on customer relation- ships, develop Best-in-Class technologies, and work together to promote excellence in manufacturing and operations. The segment management will focus on the distinct strategic, technical and capital challenges faced within each segment.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s39" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 16pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 199%;text-align: left;">With our Strategic Framework in place, Baker Hughes took advantage of opportunities in this active market.

Each division now has a vice president located in each region, who reports to the division president and is a member of a regional management council. We made this change to facilitate and strengthen our operations in all parts of the world, not only in business activity, but in the makeup of the company, with the goal of accelerating the development of an indi- genized management team.</p><p class="s37" style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 128%;text-align: left;">The realigned organization – with two business segments and a consistent regional structure – supports our long- term strategy. It complements our</p><p class="s37" style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 128%;text-align: left;">Best-in-Class product-line focus while placing decision-makers closer to our global customers – particularly the national oil companies – in areas with the highest potential for growth.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s38" style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Growth in All Regions</p><p class="s37" style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 128%;text-align: left;">Our customers around the globe increased their exploration, development and production activity in 2005, and Baker Hughes revenues grew in all four of our operating regions.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s38" style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">North America</p><p class="s37" style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 128%;text-align: left;">North American revenue increased 21% in 2005 compared to 2004. The average North American rig count was up 18% for the year, driven by an increase in land rigs, primarily drilling</p><p class="s37" style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 128%;text-align: left;">for natural gas. Horizontal drilling activity in North America also increased substan- tially compared to 2004, and the Canadian rig count ended the year at historically high levels. As a result, Baker Petrolite, Centrilift, Hughes Christensen, Baker Oil Tools and INTEQ all achieved record land- based revenue.</p><p class="s37" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 16pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 128%;text-align: left;">The average U.S. offshore rig count was down 4% in 2005, largely due to the year’s disastrous hurricane season. In the third quarter, Hurricane Dennis disrupted offshore activity, and Hurricanes Katrina and Rita caused extensive damage to our customers’ offshore drilling and produc- tion facilities. While the storms had a negative impact on third-quarter results – especially for Baker Atlas, Baker Hughes Drilling Fluids, and Baker Oil Tools – Baker Hughes offshore U.S. revenues increased 12% for the year compared to 2004.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s38" style="padding-left: 16pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Latin America</p><p class="s37" style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 16pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 128%;text-align: left;">Baker Hughes revenue in Latin America increased 15% in 2005 compared</p><p class="s37" style="padding-left: 16pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 128%;text-align: left;">to 2004, while the average rig count in the region was up by 9%. Gains were most significant in Ecuador, where Baker Oil Tools and Centrilift installed intelligent well systems and Baker Hughes Drilling Fluids conducted major projects; in Brazil, where Baker Atlas conducted deepwater logging services and INTEQ introduced advanced drilling systems; and in Argen- tina, where Centrilift won new ESP con- tracts and Hughes Christensen set</p><p class="s37" style="padding-left: 16pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">drilling records.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s38" style="padding-left: 16pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Europe, Africa, Russia and the Caspian</p><p class="s37" style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 16pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 128%;text-align: left;">Revenues from Europe, Africa, Russia and the Caspian were up 14% in 2005 compared to 2004. Revenues from INTEQ, Baker Atlas and Hughes Christensen were up broadly throughout the region. In the North Sea, several divisions combined their capabilities to deliver technically complex wells for customers in the U.K., Norwegian and Danish sectors. Hughes Christensen benefited from export sales into Russia and the Caspian area. Reve- nues in Africa increased, based on strong activity in Angola, Nigeria, Algeria, and Mauritania.

At the same time, producers are struggling to meet demand and rebuild excess production capacity.</p><p class="s37" style="padding-left: 36pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 128%;text-align: left;">With very little excess capacity, energy prices will remain high and volatile driving investment in new field development in the Middle East, Russia and West Africa.

proxies by the Board of Directors of Baker Hughes Incorporated, a Delaware corporation (“Company,” “Baker Hughes,” “we,” “us” and “our”), to be voted at the Annual Meeting of Stockholders scheduled to be held on Thursday, April 27, 2006 and at any and all reconvened meetings after adjournments thereof.</p><p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">Solicitation of proxies by mail is expected to commence on or about March 15, 2006 (the approximate date this Proxy Statement and accompanying proxy were first sent to security holders). The Company will bear the cost of the solicitation. In</p><p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">addition to solicitation by mail, certain of the directors, officers and regular employees of the Company may, without extra compensation, solicit proxies by telephone, facsimile and per- sonal interview. The Company will make arrangements with brokerage houses, custodians, nominees and other fiduciaries to send proxy material to their principals, and the Company will reimburse them for postage and clerical expenses. The Company has retained Mellon Investor Services LLC, Baker Hughes’ transfer agent and registrar, to assist in the solicita- tion of proxies from stockholders of the Company for an anticipated fee of $9,500, plus out-of-pocket expenses.</p><p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">Stockholders with shares registered in their names with Mellon Investor Services LLC may authorize a proxy by the Internet at the following Internet address: <i>http://www.eproxy. com/bhi</i>, or telephonically by calling Mellon Investor Services LLC at 1-800-435-6710. Proxies submitted through Mellon Investor Services LLC by the Internet or telephone must be received by 11:59 p.m. Eastern time (10:59 p.m. Central time) on April 26, 2006. The giving of a proxy will not affect your right to vote in person if you decide to attend the meeting.</p><p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">A number of banks and brokerage firms participate in a program that also permits stockholders to direct their vote by the Internet or telephone. This option is separate from that offered by Mellon Investor Services LLC and will be reflected on the voting form from a bank or brokerage firm that accom- panies this Proxy Statement. If your shares are held in an account at a bank or brokerage firm that participates in such a program, you may direct the vote of these shares by the Inter- net or telephone by following the instructions on the voting</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">form enclosed with the proxy from the bank or brokerage firm. Votes directed by the Internet or telephone through such a program must be received by Mellon Investor Services LLC by 11:59 p.m. Eastern time (10:59 p.m. Central time) on</p><p style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">April 26, 2006. Directing the voting of your shares will not affect your right to vote in person if you decide to attend the meeting; however, you must first request a proxy either on the Internet or the voting form that accompanies this Proxy State- ment. Requesting a proxy prior to the deadlines described above will automatically cancel any voting directions you have previously given by the Internet or by telephone with respect to your shares.</p><p style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">The Internet and telephone proxy procedures are designed to authenticate stockholders’ identities, to allow stockholders to give their proxy instructions and to confirm that those instructions have been properly recorded. Stockholders autho- rizing proxies or directing the voting of shares by the Internet should understand that there may be costs associated with electronic access, such as usage charges from access providers and telephone companies, and those costs must be borne by the stockholder.</p><h4 style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">Shares for which proxies have been executed</h4><h4 style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">will be voted as specified in the proxies.

The Board has established the Company’s Corporate Governance Guidelines (“Governance Guidelines”) as the principles of conduct of the Company’s business affairs to benefit its stockholders, which guidelines conform to the NYSE corporate governance listing standards and SEC rules.

(Employees outside the U.S. are covered under different retirement plans.) Employees who are officers of the Company participate on the same basis as other eligible employees. The Pension Plan is a tax-qualified, defined benefit plan funded entirely by the Company. Under the provisions of the Pension Plan, a cash balance account is established for each participant. Company contributions are made quarterly to the accounts, and the contribution percentage is deter- mined by the employee’s age on the last day of the quarter and is applied to quarterly eligible compensation. In addition to the Company contributions, the cash balance accounts are credited with interest credits based on the balance in the account on the last day of the quarter, using the applicable interest rate provided under section 417(e)(3)(A)(ii)(II) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. The following are the quarterly contribution rates under the Pension Plan:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s62" style="padding-bottom: 1pt;padding-left: 36pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Age at End of Quarter Percentage Contribution</p><p style="padding-left: 36pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="321" height="0" alt="image" src="NYSE_BHI_2005/Image_056.png"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 36pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Under age 35 2.0%</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 112pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">35 – 39                                                           2.5%</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 112pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">40 – 44                                                           3.0%</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 112pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">45 – 49                                                           3.5%</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 36pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">50 and older 4.0%</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 36pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">An employee is fully vested in his or her Pension Plan account after five years of service. However, regardless of the number of years of service, an employee is fully vested if the employee retires from Baker Hughes at age 65 or later, or upon the employee’s termination of employment due to the death of the employee. In addition, employees of Baker Hughes who were 55 years or older on January 1, 2002, had their prior years of service with Baker Hughes counted in the number of years of service. Employees who are fully vested are eligible for early retirement benefits starting at age 55. Pension Plan benefits in excess of $1,000 may be paid in the form of a single lump sum, a single life annuity, or if an employee is married, a joint and 50% survivor annuity.</p><p style="padding-left: 36pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">Estimated annual benefits payable upon retirement at normal retirement age (i.e., age 65) under the Baker Hughes Pension Plan to each executive named in this Proxy Statement are reflected in the following table.

Chad C. Deaton, G. Stephen Finley, James R. Clark, Alan R. Crain, Jr. and Douglas J. Wall (“Named Officers”), as well as nine other officers of the Company. The 2004 Change in Control Agreements provide for payment of certain benefits to these officers as a result of termination of employment fol- lowing, or in connection with, a Change in Control of the Company. The initial term of the 2004 Change in Control Agreement for Mr. Deaton expires on October 25, 2007. The 2004 Change in Control Agreements for the remaining Named Officers were effective as of January 1, 2006, and the initial term will expire December 31, 2007. After the expiration of the initial term, the 2004 Change in Control Agreements will be automatically extended for successive two-year periods beginning on the day immediately following the expiration date, unless, not later than 18 months prior to the expiration date or applicable renewal date, the Company shall give notice to the Named Officer that the term of the 2004 Change in Control Agreements will not be extended.</p><p style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">Pursuant to the 2004 Change in Control Agreements, the Company pays severance

Total compensation opportunity is targeted between the 50th and 75th percentile based on performance. Executives can be rewarded at the upper end of the range based on individual or company performance, as well as the executive’s experience and expertise.</p><p style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”) places a limit of $1,000,000 on the amount of compensation that may be deducted by the Com- pany in any year with respect to the Company’s Chief Execu- tive Officer and its four other highest paid executive officers, unless the compensation is performance-based compensation as described in Section 162(m) and the related regulations.</p><p style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">The Company has qualified certain compensation paid to executive officers for deductibility under Section 162(m), including certain compensation expense related to options granted pursuant to the Company’s 1993 Stock Option Plan, and certain options and other long-term performance-based stock or cash awards granted pursuant to the Company’s Long-Term Incentive Plan and the Baker Hughes Incorporated 2002 Director &amp; Officer Long-Term Incentive Plan.

Base salaries are deter- mined by evaluating an executive’s level of responsibility and experience, company-wide performance and internal and external equity.</p><p style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">After evaluating the competitive market data, increases</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">to base salaries, if any, are driven primarily by individual perfor- mance. Individual performance considers the executive’s efforts in achieving business results; promoting the Company’s core values and keys to success; continuing educational and man- agement training; improving product quality; developing rela- tionships with customers, suppliers and employees; and demonstrating leadership abilities among co-workers.</p><p style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">In setting the base salary of Mr. Deaton for fiscal year 2005, the Compensation Committee reviewed the compensa- tion of chief executive officers from a group of comparator companies and with comparable levels of experience. Based on</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 35pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">this evaluation and analysis by outside advisors, the Compen- sation Committee established a base salary of $925,000 for Mr. Deaton. Mr. Deaton’s salary will be reviewed on an ongo- ing basis using comparable data. In the future, the Compen- sation Committee expects to also consider a review of</p><p style="padding-left: 36pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">Mr. Deaton’s performance, including a review of the Compa- ny’s financial performance during the previous fiscal year with respect to revenue growth, expense control, net income and earnings per share in setting Mr. Deaton’s salary. Members</p><p style="padding-left: 36pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">of the Board of Directors that are not part of the Compensa- tion Committee will also be given the opportunity to review Mr. Deaton’s performance each year and provide input to the Compensation Committee with respect to both past performance and performance goals and objectives for the upcoming year.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 36pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Annual Incentives</h4><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 36pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">The 1995 Employee Annual Incentive Compensation Plan, as amended and restated (the “Restated Plan”), provides exec- utives with the opportunity to earn cash bonuses based on the achievement of specific Company-wide, business unit and indi- vidual performance goals.</p><p style="padding-left: 36pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">Each year, the Compensation Committee establishes specific goals relating to each executive’s bonus opportunity. Executives are assigned threshold, target and overachievement bonus levels based on a percentage of their base salary. The percentages have been established based on competitive prac- tices of the comparator group. Executives earn bonuses based on achievements of the extent to which pre-established goals are achieved. Bonus awards may be adjusted to differentiate performance among executives. However, no bonus is paid unless predetermined threshold performance levels are reached. If overachievement status is reached and surpassed, bonus awards earned over this level are paid to the executive over a two-year period.</p><p style="padding-left: 36pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">Performance goals are approved each year by the Com- pensation Committee and are based upon financial and/or strategic objectives of the Company. During fiscal year 2005, the corporate objective was based on (i) earnings per share and (ii) Baker Value Added, a Company metric that measures our operating profit after tax less the cost of capital employed as a measure of the value we create for our stockholders.</p><p style="padding-left: 36pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">Baker Value Added integrates the profit and loss results and balance sheet investments of the Company by assuring that the cost of any capital used to earn those profits is fully taken into account. Where executives have business unit responsibili- ties, a portion of the goal may be based on financial perfor- mance measures that support business unit performance.</p><p style="padding-left: 36pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">This portion varies with the position of each individual and the particular objectives of the Company.</p><p style="padding-left: 36pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">Performance targets are established by the Compensation Committee at levels that are achievable, but require above- average performance from each executive. Target bonus awards range from 45% to 100% of base salary.</p><p style="padding-left: 36pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">Each of the named executive officers received an annual bonus based on their contribution to the 2005 financial performance.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">The Restated Plan was amended and restated in January 2006. Under the Restated Plan, the maximum annual award is increased from $1,000,000 to $4,000,000, specific provisions are included to provide for the deferral of payment of any award earned over the overachievement level set by the Com- mittee and other amendments made to comply with the American Jobs Creation Act. The performance criteria under the Restated Plan is being submitted to the stockholders for approval in order to continue the qualification of the Restated Plan as generally providing for qualified performance-based compensation under Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. A copy of the Restated Plan is attached as Annex F to this Proxy Statement.</p><p style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">In addition to the bonus of $1,000,000 each earned under the Restated Plan for fiscal year 2005 performance, in Febru- ary 2006 Mr. Deaton and Mr. Clark each were awarded an additional discretionary bonus of $1,036,576 and $178,630, respectively, outside of the Restated Plan. The additional discretionary bonus was paid in recognition of the efforts</p><p style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">of Mr. Deaton and Mr. Clark during fiscal year 2005 and their contributions to the financial results of the Company during that period. A portion of the additional discretionary bonus paid to Mr. Deaton and Mr. Clark will be paid in 2007 and 2008.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">long­Term Incentives</h4><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">Long-term incentives comprise the largest portion of an executive’s total compensation package, supporting the Com- pany’s commitment to provide a total compensation package that favors at-risk pay. The Compensation Committee’s objec- tive is to provide executives with long-term incentive award opportunities that are consistent with grants made within the comparator groups.</p><p style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">Long-term incentive award guidelines are determined using competitive market references for each executive position and the individual performance of each executive. Long-term incentives are provided pursuant to the Company’s long-term incentive plans.</p><p style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">The Committee determined that, beginning in 2005, equity awards would be made in shares of restricted stock (or restricted stock units in some jurisdictions) in addition to fixed-price stock options. Restricted stock awards or units (collectively, “restricted stock”) generally vest pro rata over three years after the date of the award.</p><p style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">Stock options are granted at an option price equal to the fair market value of the Common Stock on the date prior to the date of grant. Vesting for stock options is generally pro rata over three years after the date of grant. Stock options have value if the stock price appreciates after the date the options are granted.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">The Compensation Committee determines the total stock options and restricted stock that will be made available to the Company’s executives, as well as the size of individual grants for each senior executive. The amounts vary each year and are based upon what the Compensation Committee believes is appropriate after consideration of the data provided by the independent compensation consultant as well as the execu- tive’s total compensation package.</p><p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">In fiscal year 2005, the Compensation Committee awarded grants of stock options and restricted stock to certain of the Company’s senior executives, including Messrs. Deaton, Clark, Finley, Crain and Wall to furnish an incentive for top perfor- mance for the mutual benefit of the employees, the Company and stockholders. In addition, in 2005 Mr. Wall received an award of 16,000 restricted shares of Common Stock. Mr. Wall’s award vests 25 percent on each of February 28, 2007 and 2008 with the remaining 50 percent vesting on February 28, 2009.</p><p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">In 2002, the Compensation Committee and the Compa- ny’s Board of Directors approved, subject to stockholder approval, the Baker Hughes Incorporated 2002 Director &amp; Offi- cer Long-Term Incentive Plan (the “2002 D&amp;O Plan”) for per- formance-related awards for senior executives in order to maintain a strong link to stockholders and to provide a more balanced long-term incentive program. The Company’s stock- holders approved this plan in April 2002.</p><p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">In 2005, the Compensation Committee approved perfor- mance-related awards for senior executives under the 2002 D&amp;O Plan. If the Company’s total shareholder return for the three-year period ending December 31, 2007 equals or exceeds the median of the total shareholder returns of the Morgan Stanley Oil Services Index companies (28 comparators) for the period, the Company will issue shares of Common Stock equal to the participant’s number of target shares of Common Stock for the performance award multiplied by the applicable percentage target earned factor for the Morgan Stanley Oil Services Index companies.</p><p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">In June 2005, the Committee entered into an engagement with a separate independent executive compensation consul- tant for the purpose of reviewing the Company’s long-term incentive compensation program. The Committee received and reviewed the recommendations from the consultant in Decem- ber 2005, which the Committee has taken into consideration in its overall compensation program. Based upon the advice of the consultant, the mix of long-term incentives to award exec- utives in 2006 will include stock options, restricted stock and performance units. Performance units will be paid in cash and are based on a cumulative Baker Value Added target over a three-year period.</p><p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">Performance unit targets for Baker Value Added were established by the Compensation Committee with assistance from an independent consultant. Executives were assigned entry level, expected value and overachievement levels of the Baker Value Added metric. No payout shall be made unless predetermined threshold performance levels are reached. If the overachievement level is surpassed, resulting payouts will be capped at the amount payable for the overachievement level.</p><h4 style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Summary</h4><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">The Compensation Committee believes the executive com- pensation program provides a competitive total compensation opportunity with a significant performance orientation. The annual incentive plan is designed to evaluate and reward achievement of specific objectives that drive the success of the Company. The long-term incentive awards link executives directly to stockholders and reward the Company’s executives for continuing positive stock performance on an absolute and relative basis.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p></li></ul></li><li style="padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">John Riley, Jr. (Chairman) Larry D.

The material terms include (1) the employees eligible to receive compensation upon attainment of a goal, (2) the business cri- teria on which the goals may be based, and (3) the maximum amount payable to an employee upon attainment of a goal.</p><p style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">Although the Company’s stockholders previously approved the performance criteria under the Restated Plan, Section 162(m) requires that performance criteria under plans such as the Restated Plan be approved by the Company’s stockholders every five years in order to meet the performance-based com- pensation exception to the limitation on deductions. The stockholder approval of the performance criteria under the Restated Plan serves the purpose of ensuring the tax deduct- ibility of any awards under the Restated Plan.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">performance criteria</h4><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">The following summary of the material features of the performance criteria for awards under the Restated Plan is qualified by reference to the copy of the Restated Plan which is attached as Annex F to this Proxy Statement.</p><p style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">Performance bonuses may be granted under the Restated Plan to key employees of the Company and its affiliates who are in a position to significantly contribute to the growth and profitability of the Company and/or its affiliates.</p><p style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">Under the Restated Plan, performance bonuses are subject to the satisfaction of one or more performance goals during the applicable calendar year performance period. Performance goals for awards will be determined by the Compensation Committee and will be designed to support the Company’s business strategy and align participants’ interests with stock- holder interests. Performance goals will be based on one or more of the following business criteria: Profit After Tax (as defined in the Restated Plan), Baker Value Added (as defined in the Restated Plan), earnings per share, total shareholder return, cash return on capitalization, increased revenue, reve- nue ratios, net income, stock price, market share, return on equity, return on assets, return on capital, return on capital compared to cost of capital, return on capital employed,</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">return on invested capital, shareholder value, net cash flow, operating income, earnings before interest and taxes, cash flow, cash flow from operations, cost reductions, and cost ratios. In the case of a participant other than a covered employee (within the meaning of Section 162(m) of the Code), up to 25 percent of his or her expected value bonus opportunity may be based on nonfinancial, subjective perfor- mance goals.</p><p style="padding-left: 69pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">Achievement of the goals may be measured:</p><ul id="l16"><li style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 69pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">individually, alternatively, or in any combination;</p></li><li style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 69pt;text-indent: -15pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">with respect to the Company, one or more business units, or any combination of the foregoing;</p></li><li style="padding-left: 69pt;text-indent: -15pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">on an absolute basis, or relative to a target, to a desig- nated comparison group, to results in other periods, or to other external measures; and</p></li><li style="padding-left: 69pt;text-indent: -15pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">including or excluding items determined to be extraordi- nary, unusual in nature, infrequent in occurrence, related to the acquisition or disposal of a business, or related to a change in accounting principle, in each case based on Opinion No. 30 of the Accounting Principles Board (APB Opinion No. 30), or other applicable accounting rules, or consistent with the Company’s policies and practices for measuring the achievement of performance goals on the date the Committee establishes the goals.</p></li></ul></li></ul><p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">The Compensation Committee may, in its discretion, decrease the amount payable under any award.

A simple majority vote require- ment already applies to most corporate matters involving the Company. The Board believes the Company’s existing use of a higher voting requirement in specific situations is prudent and appropriately limited in scope. Our Restated Certificate of Incorporation (“Certificate”) and Bylaws require a higher stockholder voting threshold only for fundamental corporate matters involving certain (i) business combinations, (ii) amend- ments to our Certificate and (iii) amendments to our Bylaws. We strongly believe that these voting requirements accord with good governance and serve the best interests of all stock- holders. The Company disagrees with many of the statements included in the proposal, including statements regarding the Company’s corporate governance practices. The Company has been named in <i>Institutional Investor </i>magazine’s inaugural ranking of America’s most shareholder-friendly companies. In addition, the Company has received high governance ratings from Institutional Shareholder Services, Governance Metrics and The Corporate Library.</p><p style="padding-left: 36pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">The Certificate requires approval of at least 75% of the outstanding shares of voting stock, including the affirmative vote of the holders of not less than 66<span class="s67">2</span>/<span class="s68">3</span>% of the outstanding shares of voting stock not owned by a related person, for</p><p style="padding-left: 36pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">the authorization of any business combination between the Company and a related person. The 75% voting requirement is not applicable if certain procedural and other requirements are met. This protects stockholders against self-interested actions by one or a few large stockholders. The Company’s charter documents also require approval of at least 75% of all shares of stock of the Company entitled to vote in the election of directors before changes to certain provisions of the Certifi- cate and certain amendments to the Company’s Bylaws can be made, including stockholder amendments to the Bylaws, stockholder meetings, director liability, Board structure, certain business combinations and cumulative voting. These voting requirements do not preclude changes to these corporate gov- ernance provisions, but ensure that fundamental changes can only be made with a broad consensus of stockholders. As out- lined in the Corporate Governance section of this Proxy State- ment, the Company’s governance policies and practices comply with best governance practices and all requirements of the NYSE and SEC corporate governance standards.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">Your Board believes that the voting provisions as currently contained in the Certificate and Bylaws are necessary to pre- serve the fundamental framework of the Company’s gover- nance structure. The Company’s prudent and limited use of such voting requirements has and continues to effectively safe- guard the best interests of our stockholders, and we therefore recommend a vote against this Proposal.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">recommendation of the Board of directors</h4><h4 style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">Your Board of directors recommends a vote “AgAINST” approval of Stockholder proposal No. 1 on majority voting.</h4><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s48" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">ANNuAl reporT</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">The 2005 Annual Report on Form 10-K of the Company, which includes audited financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2005, accompanies this Proxy Statement; however, that report is not part of the proxy soliciting information.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s48" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">INcorporATIoN BY refereNce</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">To the extent that this Proxy Statement is incorporated by reference into any other filing by Baker Hughes under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Exchange Act, the sections of this Proxy Statement entitled “Compensation</p><p style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">Committee Report,” “Audit/Ethics Committee Report” (to the extent permitted by the rules of the SEC) and “Corporate Per- formance Graph,” as well as the annexes to this Proxy State- ment, will not be deemed incorporated unless specifically provided otherwise in such filing.

That application can include any argu- ments, written comments, documents, records and other information relating to the claim for benefits. In addition, the claimant is entitled to receive on request and free of charge reasonable access to and copies of all information relevant to the claim. For this purpose, “relevant” means information that was relied on in making the benefit determination or that was submitted, considered or gener- ated in the course of making the determination, without regard to whether it was relied on, and information that demonstrates compliance with the Plan’s administrative procedures and safeguards for assuring and verifying that Plan provisions are applied consistently in making benefit determinations. The Plan Administrator must take into account all comments, documents, records and other information submitted by the claimant relating to the claim, without regard to whether the information was sub- mitted or considered in the initial benefit determination. The claimant may either represent himself or appoint a representative, either of whom has the right to inspect all documents pertaining to the claim and its denial.

In connection with such review, the claimant or his or her duly authorized representative may review pertinent documents and may submit issues and comments in writ- ing. The Plan Administrator shall make a decision promptly, and not later than 60 days after the Plan’s receipt of a request for review, unless special circumstances (such as the need to hold a hearing) require an extension of time for processing, in which case a decision shall be rendered as soon as possible, but not later than 120 days after receipt of a request for review.

Many LWd measurements are the same as those taken via wireline; however, taking them in real-time often allows for greater accuracy, as measurements occur before any damage has been sustained by the reservoir as a result of the drilling process.

Magnetic resonance measurements characterize the volume and type of fluids in the formation as well as providing a direct measure of permeability. at the surface, measurements are recorded digitally and can be dis- played on a continuous graph, or “well log,” which shows how each parameter varies along the length of the wellbore. Formation evaluation tools can also be used to record forma- tion pressures and take samples of formation fluids to be fur- ther evaluated on the surface.</p><p style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">Formation evaluation instrumentation can be run in the well in several ways and at different times over the life of the well. the two most common methods of data collection are wireline logging (performed by Baker atlas) and LWd (per- formed by inteQ). Wireline logging is conducted by pulling or pushing instruments through the wellbore after it is drilled,</p><p style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">while LWd instruments are attached to the drill string and take measurements while the well is being drilled. Wireline logging measurements can be made before the well’s protective steel casing is set (open hole logging) or after casing has been set (cased hole logging). Baker atlas also offers geophysical data interpretation services which help the operator interpret the petrophysical properties measured by the logging instruments and make inferences about the formation, presence and quan- tity of hydrocarbons present. this information is used to deter- mine the next steps in drilling and completing the well.</p><h4 style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">Wireline Completion and Production Services. <span class="p">Wireline completion and production services include using wireline instruments to evaluate well integrity, perform mechanical intervention and perform cement evaluations. Wireline instru- ments can also be run in producing wells to perform produc- tion logging. Baker atlas (and Baker Oil tools) also provide perforating services, which involve puncturing a well’s steel casing and cement sheath with explosive charges. this creates a fracture in the formation and provides a path for hydrocar- bons in the formation to enter the wellbore and be produced.</span></h4><p style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">Baker atlas’ services allow oil and natural gas companies to define, manage and reduce their exploration and produc- tion risk. as such, the main driver of customer purchasing decisions is the value added by formation evaluation and wire- line completion and production services.

We also assigned</p><p style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">$5.1 million to in-process research and development that was written off at the date of acquisition. the purchase price was allocated based on the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed of QuantX. the fair values were determined using a discounted cash flow approach.</p><p style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">in January 2006, we acquired nova technology Corpora- tion (“nova”) for approximately $67.0 million in cash and assumed debt. nova is a leading supplier of permanent moni- toring, chemical injection systems, and multi-line services for deepwater and subsea oil and gas well applications and will be included in the Production Optimization business unit of the Completion and Production segment.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s48" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Employees</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">On december 31, 2005, we had approximately 29,100 employees, as compared with approximately 26,900 employees on december 31, 2004. approximately 2,590 of these employ- ees are represented under collective bargaining agreements</p><p style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">or similar-type labor arrangements, of which the majority are outside the U.S. Based upon the geographic diversification of these employees, we believe any risk of loss from employee strikes or other collective actions would not be material to the conduct of our operations taken as a whole.

Our past and present operations include activities that are subject to domestic (including U.S. federal, state and local) and international regulations with regard to</p><p style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">air and water quality and other environmental matters. We believe we are in substantial compliance with these regula- tions. Regulation in this area continues to evolve, and changes in standards of enforcement of existing regulations, as well</p><p style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">as the enactment and enforcement of new legislation, may require us and our customers to modify, supplement or replace equipment or facilities or to change or discontinue present methods of operation.</p><p style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">We are involved in voluntary remediation projects at some of our present and former manufacturing facilities, the major- ity of which relate to properties obtained in acquisitions or to sites no longer actively used in operations. On rare occasions, remediation activities are conducted as specified by a govern- ment agency-issued consent decree or agreed order. Reme- diation costs are accrued based on estimates of probable exposure using currently available facts, existing environmental permits, technology and presently enacted laws and regula- tions. For sites where we are primarily responsible for the remediation, our cost estimates are developed based on inter- nal evaluations and are not discounted. Such accruals are recorded when it is probable that we will be obligated to</p><p style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">pay amounts for environmental site evaluation, remediation or related activities, and such amounts can be reasonably esti- mated. if the obligation can only be estimated within a range, we accrue the minimum amount in the range. Such accruals are recorded even if significant uncertainties exist over the ultimate cost of the remediation. Ongoing environmental compliance costs, such as obtaining environmental permits,</p><p style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">installation of pollution control equipment and waste disposal, are expensed as incurred.</p><p style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">during the year ended december 31, 2005, we spent approximately $32.1 million to comply with domestic and international standards regulating the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment (collectively, “environmental Regulations”). this cost includes the total spent on remediation projects at current or former sites, Superfund projects and environmental compliance activities, exclusive of capital. in 2006, we expect</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 36pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">to spend approximately $34.2 million to comply with environ- mental Regulations. Based upon current information, we believe that our compliance with environmental Regulations will not have a material adverse effect upon our capital expen- ditures, earnings or competitive position because we have either established adequate reserves or our cost for that com- pliance is not expected to be material to our consolidated financial statements.</p><p style="padding-left: 36pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">during the year ended december 31, 2005, we incurred approximately $3.8 million in capital expenditures for environ- mental control equipment, and we estimate we will incur approximately $6.3 million during 2006. We believe these capital expenditures for environmental control equipment</p><p style="padding-left: 36pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">will not have a material adverse effect upon our consolidated financial statements.</p><p style="padding-left: 36pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">the Comprehensive environmental Response, Compensa- tion and Liability act (known as “Superfund” or “CeRCLa”) imposes liability for the release of a “hazardous substance” into the environment. Superfund liability is imposed without regard to fault and even if the waste disposal was in compli- ance with laws and regulations. We have been identified as a potentially responsible party (“PRP”) in remedial activities</p><p style="padding-left: 36pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">related to various Superfund sites, and we accrue our share of the estimated remediation costs of the site based on the ratio of the estimated volume of waste we contributed to the site to the total volume of waste disposed at the site. With the joint and several liability imposed under Superfund, a PRP may be required to pay more than its proportional share of such costs.</p><p style="padding-left: 35pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">We have been identified as a PRP at various Superfund sites discussed below. the United States environmental Protec- tion agency (the “ePa”) and appropriate state agencies super- vise investigative and cleanup activities at these sites. For the year ended december 31, 2005, we paid $0.5 million in super- fund costs and have accrued an additional $4.9 million related to these sites. Payments made in 2005 are in addition to amounts previously paid in settlements, cash calls or other superfund costs, and these ongoing contributions reduce our financial liability for the total site cleanup costs shown below. When used in the descriptions of the sites that follow, the word <i>de minimis </i>refers to the smallest PRPs, whose contribu- tion rate is usually less than 1%.</p><ol id="l84"><li style="padding-left: 51pt;text-indent: -15pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">Baker Petrolite, Hughes Christensen, an inteQ predecessor entity, Baker Oil tools and a former subsidiary were named in april 1984 as PRPs at the Sheridan Superfund Site located in Hempstead, texas. the texas Commission on environmental Quality (“tCeQ”) is overseeing the remedial work at this site. the Sheridan Site trust was formed to manage the site remediation and we participate as a mem- ber. Based on the use of new remedial technologies, the cost projections remain at $6.0 million for full remediation, of which $5.5 million has been collected. Our additional contribution is approximately 1.8% of the remaining costs.</p></li><li style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -14pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">in 1997, we entered into a settlement agreement with Prudential insurance Company (“Prudential”) regarding cost recovery for the San Fernando Valley – Glendale Superfund. One of our predecessors operated on the Pru- dential property in Glendale. after Prudential was identi- fied as a PRP for the Glendale Superfund, they instituted legal proceedings against us for cost recovery under CeR- CLa. Without any admission of liability, we agreed to pay 40% of Prudential’s costs attributed to cleanup at the site, limited to a cap of $0.3 million. a pump and treat system was selected as the cleanup remedy at Glendale, and it is expected to operate until 2012. We continue to contribute our portion of ongoing assessments to fund this remedia- tion strategy.</p></li><li style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">in 1999, the ePa named a Hughes Christensen predeces- sor as a PRP at the Li tungsten Site in Glen Cove, new York. We contributed a <i>de minimis </i>amount of hazardous substances to the site. in december 2004, the ePa issued us a special <i>de minimis </i>settlement offer based on the fact that our contribution was limited to metals contamination, not radiological contamination, at the site. We expect to settle this matter with the ePa for less than $0.1 million.</p></li><li style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">in 1999, Baker Oil tools, Baker Petrolite and predecessor entities of Baker Petrolite were named as PRPs by the State of California’s department of toxic Substances Control for the Gibson site in Bakersfield, California. the most recent cost estimate for remediation of the site is $17.9 million. the combined volume that we contributed to the site is estimated to be less than 0.5% for liquids and 0.25%</p><p style="padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">for solids.</p></li><li style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -15pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">in 2001, a Hughes Christensen predecessor, Baker Oil tools, inteQ and one of our former subsidiaries were named as PRPs in the Force Road State Superfund Site located in Brazoria County, texas. the tCeQ is overseeing the investigation and remediation at the Force Road State Site.

While current energy prices are important contribu- tors to positive cash flow for our customers, expectations about future prices and price volatility are generally more important for determining future spending levels. While higher oil and natural gas prices generally lead to increased spending by our customers, sustained high energy prices can be an impediment to economic growth, and can therefore negatively impact spending by our customers. Our customers also take into account the volatility of energy prices and other risk</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">factors by requiring higher returns for individual projects if there is higher perceived risk. any of these factors could affect the demand for oil and natural gas and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">Supply of oil and natural gas is subject to factors beyond our control, which may adversely affect our operating results.</h4><p style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">Productive capacity for oil and natural gas is dependent on our customers’ decisions to develop and produce oil and natu- ral gas reserves. the ability to produce oil and natural gas can be affected by the number and productivity of new wells drilled and completed, as well as the rate of production and resulting depletion of existing wells. advanced technologies, such as horizontal drilling, improve total recovery but also result in a more rapid production decline.</p><p style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">access to prospects and capital are also important to our customers. access to prospects may be limited because host governments do not allow access to the reserves or because another oil and natural gas exploration company owns the rights to develop the prospect. access to capital is dependent on our customers’ ability to access the funds necessary to develop economically attractive projects based on their expec- tations of future energy prices, required investments and resulting returns. Government regulations and the costs incurred by oil and natural gas exploration companies to conform to and comply with government regulations, may also limit the quantity of oil and natural gas that may be economically produced.</p><p style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">Supply can be interrupted by a number of factors includ- ing political instability, civil unrest, labor issues, terrorist attacks, war or military activity. Key oil producing countries which could be subject to supply interruptions include, but are not limited to, Saudi arabia, iran, iraq and other Middle eastern countries, nigeria, norway, Russia and Venezuela. the impact of supply and demand disruptions on oil and natural gas prices and oil and natural gas price volatility is tempered by the size and expected duration of the disruption relative to the excess productive capacity at the time of the disruption.</p><p style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">Supply can also be impacted by the degree to which indi- vidual Organization of Petroleum exporting Countries (“OPeC”) nations and other large oil and natural gas produc- ing countries, including, but not limited to, Mexico, norway and Russia, are willing and able to control production and exports of oil, to decrease or increase supply and to support their targeted oil price while meeting their market share objec- tives. any of these factors could affect the supply of oil and natural gas and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">Excess productive capacity and future demand impact our operations.</h4><p style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">Oil and natural gas storage inventory levels are an indica- tor of the relative balance between supply and demand. High or increasing storage or inventories generally indicate that sup- ply is exceeding demand and that energy prices are likely to soften. Low or decreasing storage or inventories are an indicator</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">that demand is growing faster than supply and that energy prices are likely to rise. Measures of maximum productive capacity compared to demand (“excess productive capacity”) are also an important factor influencing energy prices and spending by oil and natural gas exploration companies. When excess productive capacity is low compared to demand, energy prices tend to be higher and more volatile reflecting the increased vulnerability of the entire system to disruption.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">Seasonal and adverse weather conditions adversely affect demand for our services and operations.</h4><p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">Weather can also have a significant impact on demand as consumption of energy is seasonal and any variation from nor- mal weather patterns, cooler or warmer summers and winters, can have a significant impact on demand. adverse weather conditions, such as hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico, may interrupt or curtail our operations, or our customers’ opera- tions, cause supply disruptions and result in a loss of revenue and damage to our equipment and facilities, which may or may not be insured.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s48" style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">risk Factors related to our Business</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">Our expectations regarding our business are affected by the following risk factors and the timing of any of these risk factors:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">We operate in a highly competitive environment, which may adversely affect our ability to succeed.</h4><p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">We operate in a highly competitive environment for mar- keting oil and natural gas and securing equipment and trained personnel. Our ability to continually provide competitive prod- ucts and services can impact our ability to maintain or increase prices for our products and services, maintain market share and negotiate acceptable contract terms with our customers. in order to be competitive, we must provide new technologies, and reliable products and services that perform as expected and that create value for our customers. Our ability to main- tain or increase prices for our products and services is in part dependent on the industry’s capacity relative to customer demand, and on our ability to differentiate the value delivered by our products and services from our competitor’s products and services. in addition, our ability to negotiate acceptable contract terms and conditions with our customers, especially state-owned national oil companies, our ability to manage warranty claims and our ability to effectively manage our commercial agents can also impact our results of operations.</p><p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">Managing development of competitive technology and new product introductions on a forecasted schedule and at forecasted costs can impact our financial results. development of competing technology that accelerates the obsolescence of any of our products or services can have a detrimental impact on our financial results and can result in the potential impair- ment of long-lived assets.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">We may be disadvantaged competitively and financially by a significant movement of exploration and production opera- tions to areas of the world in which we are not currently active.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">The high cost or unavailability of materials, equipment, supplies and personnel could adversely affect our ability to execute our operations on a timely basis.</h4><p style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">Our manufacturing operations are dependent on having sufficient raw materials, component parts and manufacturing capacity available to meet our manufacturing plans at a rea- sonable cost while minimizing inventories. Our ability to effec- tively manage our manufacturing operations and meet these goals can have an impact on our business, including our ability to meet our manufacturing plans and revenue goals, control costs and avoid shortages of raw materials and component parts. Raw materials and components of particular concern include steel alloys, copper, carbide, chemicals and electronic components. Our ability to repair or replace equipment dam- aged or lost in the well can also impact our ability to service our customers.</p><p style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">People are a key resource to developing, manufacturing and delivering our products and services to our customers around the world. Our ability to recruit, train and retain the highly skilled workforce required by our plans will impact our business. a well-trained, motivated work force has a positive impact on our ability to attract and retain business. Rapid growth presents a challenge to us and our industry to recruit, train and retain our employees while managing the impact of wage inflation and potential lack of available qualified labor in the markets where we operate. Labor-related actions, includ- ing strikes, slowdowns and facility occupations can also have a negative impact on our business.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">Compliance with and changes in laws and regulations and risks from investigations and legal proceedings could be costly and could adversely affect operating results.</h4><p style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">Our operations in the U.S. and over 90 countries can be impacted by expected and unexpected changes in the legal and business environments in which we operate, as well as the outcome of ongoing government and internal investigations and legal proceedings.</p><p style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">Changes that could impact the legal environment include new legislation, new regulation, new policies, investigations and legal proceedings and new interpretations of the existing legal rules and regulations. in particular, changes in export control laws or exchange control laws, additional restrictions on doing business in countries subject to sanctions, and changes in laws in Russia or other countries identified by man- agement for immediate focus. Changes that impact the busi- ness environment include changes in accounting standards, changes in environmental laws, changes in tax laws or tax rates, the resolution of audits by various tax authorities, and the ability to fully utilize our tax loss carryforwards and tax credits. Compliance related issues could limit our ability to do business in certain countries.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 36pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">these changes could have a significant financial impact on our future operations and the way we conduct, or if we con- duct, business in the affected countries.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 36pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">uninsured claims and litigation could adversely impact our operating results.</h4><p style="padding-left: 36pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">We have insurance coverage against operating hazards, including product liability claims and personal injury claims related to our products, to the extent deemed prudent by our management and to the extent insurance is available, but no assurance can be given that the nature and amount of that insurance will be sufficient to fully indemnify us against liabili- ties arising out of pending and future claims and litigation. this insurance has deductibles or self-insured retentions and contains certain coverage exclusions. the insurance does not cover damages from breach of contract by us or based on alleged fraud or deceptive trade practices.

Local expenses and some of our manufacturing costs are incurred in local currencies and therefore changes in the exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and foreign currencies, particularly the British Pound Sterling, euro, Canadian dollar, norwegian Krone, Venezuelan Bolivar, australian dollar and Brazilian Real, can increase or decrease our U.S. dollar expenses and impact our operating margins. the majority of our significant foreign subsidiaries have designated the local currency as their func- tional currency and, as such, gains and losses resulting from balance sheet translation of foreign operations are included as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive loss within stockholders’ equity. Gains and losses from foreign currency transactions, such as those resulting from the settle- ment of receivables or payables in the non-functional currency, are included in the consolidated statements of operations as incurred. For those foreign subsidiaries that have designated the U.S. dollar as the functional currency, gains and losses resulting from balance sheet translation of foreign operations are also included in the consolidated statements of operations as incurred. Such transaction and translation losses may adversely impact our results of operations.</p><p style="padding-left: 26pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">the condition of the capital markets and equity markets in general can affect the price of our common stock and our</p><p style="padding-left: 26pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">ability to obtain financing, if necessary. if the Company’s credit rating is downgraded, this would increase our costs under our credit agreement, as well as the cost of obtaining, or make it more difficult to obtain or issue, new debt financing.</p><p style="padding-left: 26pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">Our ability to forecast the size of and changes in the worldwide oil and natural gas industry and our ability to forecast our customers’ activity levels and demand for our products and services impacts our management of our manu- facturing and distribution activities, our staffing levels and our cash and financing requirements.

LEgaL ProCEEDINgS</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">We are involved in litigation or proceedings that have arisen in our ordinary business activities. We insure against these risks to the extent deemed prudent by our management and to the extent insurance is available, but no assurance can be given that the nature and amount of that insurance will be sufficient to fully indemnify us against liabilities arising out of pending and future legal proceedings. Many of these insur- ance policies contain deductibles or self-insured retentions in amounts we deem prudent and for which we are responsible for payment. in determining the amount of self-insurance, it is our policy to self-insure those losses that are predictable,</p><p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">measurable and recurring in nature, such as claims for automo- bile liability, general liability and workers compensation. We record accruals for the uninsured portion of losses related to these types of claims. the accruals for losses are calculated by estimating losses for claims using historical claim data, specific loss development factors and other information as necessary.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">On September 12, 2001, we, without admitting or deny- ing the factual allegations contained in the Order, consented with the Securities and exchange Commission (“SeC”) to the entry of an Order making Findings and imposing a Cease-and- desist Order (the “Order”) for violations of Section 13(b)(2)(a) and Section 13(b)(2)(B) of the exchange act. among the find- ings included in the Order were the following: in 1999, we discovered that certain of our officers had authorized an improper $75,000 payment to an indonesian tax official, after which we embarked on a corrective course of conduct, includ- ing voluntarily and promptly disclosing the misconduct to the SeC and the department of Justice (the “dOJ”). in the course of our investigation of the indonesia matter, we learned that we had made payments in the amount of $15,000 and</p><p style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">$10,000 in india and Brazil, respectively, to our agents, with- out taking adequate steps to ensure that none of the pay- ments would be passed on to foreign government officials. the Order found that the foregoing payments violated Section 13(b)(2)(a). the Order also found us in violation of Section 13(b)(2)(B) because we did not have a system of internal con- trols to determine if payments violated the Foreign Corrupt Practices act (“FCPa”). the FCPa makes it unlawful for U.S. issuers, including us, or anyone acting on their behalf, to make improper payments to any foreign official in order to obtain or retain business. in addition, as discussed below, the FCPa establishes accounting and internal control requirements for</p><p style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">U.S. issuers. We cooperated with the SeC’s investigation.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">By the Order, dated September 12, 2001 (previously dis- closed by us and incorporated by reference in this annual report as exhibit 99.1), we agreed to cease and desist from committing or causing any violation and any future violation of Section 13(b)(2)(a) and Section 13(b)(2)(B) of the exchange act. Such Sections of the exchange act require issuers to:</p><p style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">(x) make and keep books, records and accounts, which, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the issuer and (y) devise and maintain a system of internal accounting controls sufficient to provide reasonable assurances that: (i) transactions are exe- cuted in accordance with management’s general or specific authorization; and (ii) transactions are recorded as necessary:</p><p style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">(i) to permit preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles or any other criteria applicable to such statements, and (ii) to maintain accountability for assets.</p><p style="padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">On March 29, 2002, we announced that we had been advised that the SeC and the dOJ are conducting investiga- tions into allegations of violations of law relating to nigeria and other related matters. the SeC has issued a formal order of investigation into possible violations of provisions under the Foreign Corrupt Practices act (“FCPa”) regarding anti-bribery, books and records and internal controls. the SeC has issued subpoenas seeking information about our operations in angola (subpoena dated august 6, 2003) and Kazakhstan (subpoenas dated august 6, 2003 and april 22, 2005) as part of its ongoing investigation. We are providing documents to</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 36pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">and cooperating fully with the SeC and dOJ. the dOJ and the SeC have issued subpoenas to, or otherwise asked for inter- views with, current and former employees in connection with the investigations regarding nigeria, angola and Kazakhstan. in addition, we have conducted internal investigations into these matters.</p><p style="padding-left: 36pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">Our internal investigations have identified issues regarding the propriety of certain payments and apparent deficiencies in our books and records and internal controls with respect to certain operations in nigeria, angola and Kazakhstan, as well as potential liabilities to governmental authorities in nigeria. the internal investigation in nigeria was substantially com- pleted during the first quarter of 2003, and, based upon cur- rent information, we do not expect that any such potential liabilities will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements. the internal investigations in angola and Kazakhstan were substantially completed in the third quarter of 2004. evidence obtained during the course of the internal investigations has been provided to the SeC and dOJ.</p><p style="padding-left: 35pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">the department of Commerce, department of the navy and dOJ (the “U.S. agencies”) have investigated compliance with certain export licenses issued to Western Geophysical from 1994 through 2000 for export of seismic equipment leased by the People’s Republic of China. We acquired Western Geophysical in august 1998 and subsequently transferred related assets to WesternGeco in december 2000. Western- Geco continued to use the licenses until 2001. Under the WesternGeco Formation agreement, we owe indemnity to WesternGeco for certain matters and, accordingly, we have agreed to indemnify WesternGeco with certain limitations in connection with this matter. We are cooperating fully with the</p><p style="padding-left: 36pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">U.S. agencies.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 35pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">We have received a subpoena from a grand jury in the Southern district of new York regarding goods and services we delivered to iraq from 1995 through 2003 during the United nations Oil-for-Food Program. We have also received a request from the SeC to provide a written statement and cer- tain information regarding our participation in that program. We have responded to both the subpoena and the request and may provide additional information and documents in the future. Other companies in the energy industry are believed to have received similar subpoenas and requests.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 14pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">the U.S. agencies, the SeC and other authorities have a broad range of civil and criminal sanctions they may seek to impose against corporations and individuals in appropriate circumstances including, but not limited to, injunctive relief, disgorgement, fines, penalties and modifications to business practices and compliance programs. Such agencies and authorities have entered into agreements with, and obtained a range of sanctions against, several public corporations and individuals arising from allegations of improper payments and deficiencies in books and records and internal controls, whereby civil and criminal penalties were imposed, including in some cases multi-million dollar fines and other sanctions. We are in discussions with the U.S. agencies and the SeC regarding the resolution, including sanctions, associated with certain of the matters described above. it is not possible to accurately predict at this time when any of these matters will be resolved. Based on current information, we cannot predict the outcome of such investigations, whether we will reach resolution through such discussions or what, if any, actions may be taken by the U.S. agencies, the SeC or other authori- ties or the effect the actions may have on our consolidated financial statements.</p><p style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">On May 10, 2004, the district Court of andrews County, texas entered a judgment in favor of LOtUS, LLC and against inteQ in the amount of $14.8 million for lost profits resulting from a breach of contract in drilling a well to create a salt cav- ern for disposing of naturally occurring radioactive waste. We have filed an appeal and taken other actions. We believe that any liability that we may incur as a result of this litigation would not have a material adverse financial effect on our con- solidated financial statements.</p><p style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">Further information is contained in the “environmental Matters” section of item 1 herein.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s48" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">ITEM 4.

On February 22, 2006, we entered into another Plan for a term that will run from February 23, 2006 until april 30, 2006, unless earlier terminated. during that term, the agent will use its best efforts to repurchase a fixed dollar value of our common stock each trading day, subject to applicable trading rules, until the cumulative amount purchased under the november Plan equals $250.0 million and under the February Plan equals $150.0 million, inclusive of all commissions and fees paid by us to the agent related to such repurchases. Shares will be repurchased by the agent at the prevailing market prices, subject to limitations provided by us, in open market transactions intended to comply with Rule 10b-18 of the exchange act.

We compete as one of the three largest diversified oilfield services companies. in early 2005, we organized our product-line focused divisions into two separate segments: the drilling and evaluation segment and the Completion and Production segment. the segments are aligned by product line based on the types of products and services provided to our customers and on the business char- acteristics of the divisions during business cycles. activity of the businesses under the drilling and evaluation segment is closely correlated to rig counts and, therefore, is prone to cyclicality as drilling activity increases or decreases. activity of businesses in the Completion and Production segment is more dependent on production volumes and, therefore, is less cyclical than the drilling and evaluation segment.

We oper- ate in over 90 countries around the world and employ approxi- mately 29,100 employees – about one-half of which work outside the U.S. Our revenue in 2005 was $7.2 billion – approx- imately 36% of which came from providing products and ser- vices to oil and natural gas companies operating in the U.S.</p><p style="padding-left: 36pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">during 2005, the Baker Hughes worldwide rig count con- tinued to increase, as oil and natural gas companies around the world recognized the need to build productive capacity to meet the growing demand for hydrocarbons and to offset depletion of existing developed reserves. Oil and natural gas prices were at historic highs in 2005, reflecting continued strong demand, relatively low excess productive capacity, and disruptions in supply due to hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico.</p><p style="padding-left: 36pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">We reported revenues of $7,185.5 million for 2005, an 18.2% increase compared with 2004, approximating the 14.8% increase in the worldwide average rig count for 2005 com- pared with 2004. in addition to the growth in our revenues from increased activity, our revenues were impacted by pricing improvements and changes in market share in certain product lines. net income for 2005 was $878.4 million, a 66.2% increase compared with $528.6 million in 2004.</p><ul id="l87"><li style="padding-left: 51pt;text-indent: -15pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">north american revenues increased 20.9% in 2005 com- pared with 2004, while the rig count increased 18.0% for 2005 compared with 2004, driven primarily by land-based drilling for natural gas. in 2005, hurricane-related disrup- tions negatively impacted our revenues from the U.S. off- shore market by approximately $68.0 million.</p></li><li style="padding-left: 51pt;text-indent: -15pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">Latin american revenues increased 15.3% and the Latin american rig count increased 9.0% in 2005 compared with 2004.</p></li><li style="padding-left: 51pt;text-indent: -15pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">europe, africa, Russia and the Caspian revenues increased 14.0% in 2005 compared with 2004.

Our ability to compete in the oilfield services market is dependent on our ability to differentiate our product and service offerings by technology, service and the price paid for the value we deliver.</p><p style="padding-left: 36pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">the primary driver of our business is our customers’ capital and operating expenditures dedicated to exploring and drilling for and developing and producing oil and natural gas. Our business is cyclical and is dependent upon our customers’</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">forecasts of future oil and natural gas prices, future economic growth and hydrocarbon demand and estimates of future oil and natural gas production. during 2005, our customers’ spending directed to both worldwide oil and north american oil and natural gas projects increased compared with 2004. the increase in spending was driven by the multi-year requirement to find, develop and produce more hydrocarbons to meet the growth in demand, offset production declines, increase inven- tory levels and rebuild productive capacity. additionally, the increase was supported by historically high oil and natural gas prices. Our customers’ spending on oil and gas projects is expected to continue to grow through 2006.</p><p style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">the critical success factors for our business are embodied in our long-term strategy, which we call our Strategic Framework. this strategy includes the development and maintenance of</p><p style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">a high performance culture founded on our Core Values; our product line focused organization and our focus on Best-in- Class opportunities; maintaining our financial flexibility and financial discipline; and execution of our strategies for product development and commercialization, manufacturing quality and service quality.</p><p style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">Our ongoing effort to develop and maintain a high perfor- mance culture starts with our Core Values of integrity, team- work, performance and learning. We employ succession planning efforts to develop leaders across all our businesses that embody these Core Values and represent the diversity of our customer base. We hire and train employees from around the world to ensure that we have a well-trained workforce in place to support our business plans.</p><p style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">Our focus on Best-in-Class opportunities starts with our product line focused organization structure. We believe that through our product line focused divisions, we develop the technologies that deliver Best-in-Class value to our customers. as an enterprise, we are also focused on those markets that we believe provide Best-in-Class opportunities for growth. Our management team has identified markets for immediate focus including the Middle east, Russia and the Caspian region and nOCs.</p><p style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">Our focus on financial flexibility and financial discipline is the backbone of our effort to deliver differential growth at superior margins while earning an acceptable return on our investments throughout the business cycle. investments are given priority and funded depending on their ability to provide risk-adjusted returns in excess of our cost of capital. Our effort to obtain the best price for our products and services begins with our approach to capital discipline. Over the past few years, we have invested for growth in our business, repaid debt, paid dividends and repurchased stock, and we expect to maintain the flexibility to undertake such activities in the future.</p><p style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">the last element of our Strategic Framework focuses on our ability to identify, develop and commercialize new products and services that will lead to differential growth at superior margins in our business. the effort extends to every phase of our operations, including continuous improvement programs in our manufacturing facilities and field operations that sup- port our goal of flawless execution at the well site.</p><p style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">the execution of our 2006 business plan and the ability to meet our 2006 financial objectives are dependent on a num-</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">ber of factors. these factors include, but are not limited to, our ability to: recruit, train and retain the skilled and diverse workforce necessary to meet our business needs; realize price increases commensurate with the value we provide to our customers and in excess of the increase in raw material and labor costs; expand our business in areas that are growing rapidly with customers whose spending is expected to increase substantially (such as nOCs), and in areas where we have market share opportunities (such as the Middle east, Russia and the Caspian region); manage increasing raw material</p><p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">and component costs (especially steel alloys, copper, carbide, chemicals and electronic components); continue to make ongoing improvements in the productivity of our manufac- turing organization.</p><p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">For a full discussion of risk factors and forward-looking statements, please see the “Risk Factors Related to the World- wide Oil and natural Gas industry” and the “Risk Factors Related to Our Business” in item 1a.

Revenues in 2006 are expected to increase by approximately 19% to 21%, in line with the expected increase in customer spending. We expect the growth in our revenues will primarily be due to increased activity and pricing improvement. Our assumptions regarding overall growth in customer spending assume strong economic growth in the</p><p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">U.S. and China, resulting in an average oil price exceeding</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">$50/Bbl. Our assumptions regarding customer spending in north america assume strong economic growth in the U.S. and natural gas prices exceeding an average of $8/mmBtu.</p><p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">in north america, we expect revenues to increase approxi- mately 21% to 23% in 2006 compared with 2005. We expect</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 25pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">spending on land-based projects to continue to increase in 2006 driven by demand for natural gas, following the trend evident in 2005. We also expect offshore spending in the Gulf of Mexico to increase modestly in 2006 compared with 2005. the normal weather-driven seasonal decline in U.S. and Canadian spending in the first half of the year should result in sequentially softer revenues in the first and second quarters of 2006.</p><p style="padding-left: 40pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">in 2005, 2004 and 2003, revenues outside north america</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 25pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">were 57.6%, 58.5% and 57.9% of total revenues, respec- tively. in 2006, we expect revenues outside north america to continue to be between 55% and 60% of total revenues, and we expect these revenues to increase approximately 18% to 21% in 2006 compared with 2005, continuing the multi-year trend of growth in customer spending. Spending on large projects by nOCs is expected to reflect established seasonality trends, resulting in softer revenues in the first half of the year and stronger revenues in the second half. in addition, cus- tomer spending should be affected by weather-related reduc- tions in the north Sea in the first and second quarters of 2006. the Middle east, africa and Latin america regions are expected to grow modestly in 2006 compared with 2005. Our expectations for spending and revenue growth could decrease if there are disruptions in key oil and natural gas production markets, such as Venezuela or nigeria.</p><p style="padding-left: 25pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">in 2005, WesternGeco contributed $96.7 million of equity in income of affiliates compared with $34.5 million of equity in income of affiliates in 2004. We expect the trend of improv- ing operating results for WesternGeco to continue throughout 2006. information regarding WesternGeco’s profitability in 2006 is based on information that WesternGeco has provided to us. Should this information not be accurate, our forecasts for profitability could be impacted, either positively or negatively.</p><p style="padding-left: 25pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">Based on the above forecasts, we believe net income per diluted share in 2006 will be in the range of $3.40 to $3.60, which includes the impact of expensing stock option awards and stock issued under the employee stock purchase plan of between $18.0 million and $20.0 million, net of tax. Signifi- cant price increases, lower than expected raw material and labor costs, higher than planned activity or significantly better than expected results from WesternGeco could cause earnings per share to reach the upper end of this range. Conversely, less than expected price increases, higher than expected raw material and labor costs, lower than expected productivity or significantly worse than expected results at WesternGeco could result in earnings per share being at or below the bot- tom of this range. Our ability to improve pricing is dependent on demand for our products and services and our competitors strategies of managing capacity. While the commercial intro- duction of new technology is an important factor in realizing pricing improvement, without pricing discipline throughout the industry as a whole, meaningful improvements in our prices are not likely to be realized. additionally, significant changes in drilling activity outside our expectations could impact operat- ing results positively or negatively.</p><p style="padding-left: 25pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">We do business in approximately 90 countries including over one-half of the 35 countries having the lowest scores, which indicates high levels of corruption, in transparency international’s Corruption Perception index (“CPi”) survey for</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 36pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">2005. We devote significant resources to the development, maintenance and enforcement of our Business Code of Con- duct policy, our Foreign Corrupt Practices act (the “FCPa”) policy, our internal control processes and procedures and other compliance related policies. notwithstanding the devotion of such resources, and in part as a consequence thereof, from time to time we discover or receive information alleging potential violations of laws and regulations, including the FCPa and our policies, processes and procedures. We conduct internal investi- gations of these potential violations and take appropriate action depending upon the outcome of the investigation. in addition,</p><p style="padding-left: 36pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">U.S. government agencies and authorities are conducting investigations into allegations of potential violations of laws.</p><p style="padding-left: 36pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">We anticipate that the devotion of significant resources to compliance related issues, including the necessity for investiga- tions, will continue to be an aspect of doing business in a number of the countries in which oil and natural gas explora- tion, development and production take place and in which we are requested to conduct operations. Compliance related issues could limit our ability to do business in these countries. in order to provide products and services in some of these countries, we may in the future utilize ventures with third parties, sell products to distributors or otherwise modify our business approach in order to improve our ability to conduct our business in accordance with laws and regulations and our Business Code of Conduct. in the third quarter of 2005, our independent foreign subsidiaries initiated a process to prohibit any business activity that directly or indirectly involves or facilitates transac- tions in iran, Sudan or with their governments, including gov- ernment-controlled companies operating outside of these countries. implementation of this process should be substan- tially complete by the end of 2006 and is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 36pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">risk Factors related to our Business</h4><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 36pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">For discussion of our risk factors and cautions regarding forward-looking statements, see the “Risk Factors Related to Our Business” in item 1a.

We base these estimates and judgments on historical experience and other assumptions and information that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. estimates and assumptions about future events and their effects cannot be perceived with certainty, and accordingly, these estimates may change as new events occur, as more experience is acquired, as additional information is obtained and as the business environment in which we operate changes.</p><p style="padding-left: 36pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">We have defined a critical accounting estimate as one that is both important to the portrayal of either our financial condi- tion or results of operations and requires us to make difficult, subjective or complex judgments or estimates about matters</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">that are uncertain. We have discussed the development and selection of our critical accounting estimates with the audit/ ethics Committee of our Board of directors and the audit/ethics Committee has reviewed the disclosure presented below. during the past three fiscal years, we have not made any material changes in the methodology used to establish the critical accounting estimates discussed below. We believe that the following are the critical accounting estimates used in the prep- aration of our consolidated financial statements. in addition, there are other items within our consolidated financial state- ments that require estimation but are not deemed critical as defined above.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">allowance for Doubtful accounts</h4><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 14pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">the determination of the collectibility of amounts due from our customers requires us to use estimates and make judgments regarding future events and trends, including monitoring our customers’ payment history and current credit worthiness to determine that collectibility is reasonably</p><p style="padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">assured, as well as consideration of the overall business climate in which our customers operate. inherently, these uncertainties require us to make frequent judgments and estimates regard- ing our customers’ ability to pay amounts due us in order to determine the appropriate amount of valuation allowances required for doubtful accounts. Provisions for doubtful accounts are recorded when it becomes evident that the cus- tomer will not make the required payments at either contrac- tual due dates or in the future. at december 31, 2005 and 2004, allowance for doubtful accounts totaled $51.4 million, or 3.0%, and $50.2 million, or 3.6%, of total gross accounts receivable, respectively. We believe that our allowance for doubtful accounts is adequate to cover potential bad debt losses under current conditions; however, uncertainties regard- ing changes in the financial condition of our customers, either adverse or positive, could impact the amount and timing of any additional provisions for doubtful accounts that may be required. a five percent change in the allowance for doubtful accounts would have had a pre-tax impact of approximately</p><p style="padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">$2.6 million in 2005.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Inventory reserves</h4><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">inventory is a significant component of current assets and is stated at the lower of cost or market. this requires us to record provisions and maintain reserves for excess, slow moving and obsolete inventory. to determine these reserve amounts, we regularly review inventory quantities on hand and compare them to estimates of future product demand,</p><p style="padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">market conditions, production requirements and technological developments. these estimates and forecasts inherently include uncertainties and require us to make judgments regarding potential outcomes. at december 31, 2005 and 2004, inventory reserves totaled $201.3 million, or 15.2%, and $220.0 million, or 17.7%, of gross inventory, respectively. We believe that our reserves are adequate to properly value potential excess, slow moving and obsolete inventory under current conditions. Significant or unanticipated changes to our estimates and forecasts, either adverse or positive, could impact the amount and timing of any additional provisions</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">for excess or obsolete inventory that may be required. a five percent change in this inventory reserve balance would have had a pre-tax impact of approximately $10.1 million in 2005.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Impairment of Long-Lived assets</h4><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">Long-lived assets, which include property, goodwill, intan- gible assets, investments in affiliates and certain other assets, comprise a significant amount of our total assets. We review the carrying values of these assets for impairment periodically, and at least annually for goodwill, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable. an impairment loss is recorded in the period in which it is determined that the carrying amount is not recoverable. this requires us to make judgments regarding long-term forecasts of future revenues and costs related to the assets subject to review. in turn, these forecasts are uncertain in that they require assumptions about demand for our prod- ucts and services, future market conditions and technological developments. Significant and unanticipated changes to these assumptions could require a provision for impairment in a future period. Given the nature of these evaluations and their application to specific assets and specific times, it is not possi- ble to reasonably quantify the impact of changes in these assumptions; however, based upon our evaluation of the cur- rent business climate in which we operate, we do not currently anticipate that any significant asset impairment losses will be necessary in the foreseeable future.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Income Taxes</h4><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">the liability method is used for determining our income taxes, under which current and deferred tax liabilities and assets are recorded in accordance with enacted tax laws and rates. Under this method, the amounts of deferred tax liabili- ties and assets at the end of each period are determined using the tax rate expected to be in effect when taxes are actually paid or recovered. Valuation allowances are established to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be real- ized. in determining the need for valuation allowances, we have considered and made judgments and estimates regarding estimated future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. these estimates and judg- ments include some degree of uncertainty and changes in these estimates and assumptions could require us to adjust the valuation allowances for our deferred tax assets. Historically, changes to valuation allowances have been caused by major changes in the business cycle in certain countries and changes in local country law. the ultimate realization of the deferred tax assets depends on the generation of sufficient taxable income in the applicable taxing jurisdictions.</p><p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">We operate in more than 90 countries under many legal forms. as a result, we are subject to the jurisdiction of numerous domestic and foreign tax authorities, as well as to tax agree- ments and treaties among these governments. Our operations in these different jurisdictions are taxed on various bases: actual income before taxes, deemed profits (which are generally deter- mined using a percentage of revenues rather than profits) and withholding taxes based on revenue. determination of taxable</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">income in any jurisdiction requires the interpretation of the related tax laws and regulations and the use of estimates and assumptions regarding significant future events such as the amount, timing and character of deductions, permissible reve- nue recognition methods under the tax law and the sources and character of income and tax credits. Changes in tax laws, regulations, agreements and treaties, foreign currency exchange restrictions or our level of operations or profitability in each taxing jurisdiction could have an impact on the amount of income taxes that we provide during any given year.</p><p style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">Our tax filings for various periods are subjected to audit  by the tax authorities in most jurisdictions where we conduct business. these audits may result in assessments of additional taxes that are resolved with the authorities or potentially through the courts. We believe these assessments may occa- sionally be based on erroneous and even arbitrary interpreta- tions of local tax law. Resolution of these situations inevitably includes some degree of uncertainty; accordingly, we provide taxes only for the amounts we believe will ultimately result from these proceedings. the resulting change to our tax liabil- ity, if any, is dependent on numerous factors that are difficult to estimate. these include, among others, the amount and nature of additional taxes potentially asserted by local tax authorities; the willingness of local tax authorities to negotiate a fair settlement through an administrative process; the impar- tiality of the local courts; the sheer number of countries in which we do business; and the potential for changes in the tax paid to one country to either produce, or fail to produce, an offsetting tax change in other countries. Our experience has been that the estimates and assumptions we have used to</p><p style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">provide for future tax assessments have proven to be appropri- ate. However, past experience is only a guide, and the poten- tial exists, however limited, that the tax resulting from the resolution of current and potential future tax controversies may differ materially from the amount accrued. although we have provided for the taxes that we believe will ultimately be payable as a result of these assessments, the aggregate assess- ments are approximately $34.1 million in excess of the taxes provided for in our consolidated financial statements.</p><p style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">in addition to the aforementioned assessments that have been received from various taxing authorities, we provide for taxes in certain situations where assessments have not been received. in those situations, we consider it probable that the taxes ultimately payable will exceed those amounts reflected in filed tax returns; accordingly, taxes are provided in those situa- tions under the guidance in Statement of Financial accounting Standards (“SFaS”) no. 5, <i>Accounting for Contingencies</i>.</p><p style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">Future events such as changes in the facts or tax law, judicial decisions regarding existing law or a favorable audit outcome may later indicate the assertion of additional taxes is no longer probable. in that circumstance, it is possible that taxes previ- ously provided would be released.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Pensions and Postretirement Benefit obligations</h4><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">Pensions and postretirement benefit obligations and the related plan expenses are calculated using actuarial models and methods. this involves the use of two critical assumptions, the discount rate and the expected rate of return on assets, both of</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 36pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">which are important elements in determining plan expenses and in measuring plan assets and liabilities. We evaluate these criti- cal assumptions at least annually. although considered less criti- cal, other assumptions used in determining benefit obligations and plan expenses, such as demographic factors like retirement age, mortality and turnover, are also evaluated periodically and are updated to reflect our actual and expected experience.</p><p style="padding-left: 36pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">the discount rate enables us to state expected future cash flows at a present value on the measurement date. a lower dis- count rate increases the present value of benefit obligations and increases plan expenses. We used a discount rate of 6.00% in 2005, 6.25% in 2004 and 6.75% in 2003 to determine plan expenses. a 50 basis point reduction in the discount rate would have increased plan expenses in 2005 by $3.4 million.</p><p style="padding-left: 36pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">to determine the expected rate of return on plan assets, we consider the current and expected asset allocations, as well as historical and expected returns on various categories of plan assets. a lower rate of return increases plan expenses. We assumed rates of return on our plan investments were 8.50% in 2005, 2004 and 2003. a 50 basis point reduction in the expected rate of return on assets of our principal plans would have increased plan expenses in 2005 by $2.9 million.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s48" style="padding-left: 36pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Discontinued operations</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 35pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">in the fourth quarter of 2005, our management initiated and our Board of directors approved a plan to sell the Baker Supply Products division (“SPd”), a product line group within the Completion and Production segment. SPd distributes basic supplies, products and small tools to the drilling industry. in January 2006, we signed a non-binding letter of intent for the sale of SPd. SPd had revenues of $32.5 million for the year ended december 31, 2005. the sale is expected to close in the first quarter of 2006. this transaction is subject to the negotia- tion and execution of a definitive sale agreement, as well as, various conditions, including satisfactory due diligence review of SPd’s business. there can be no assurance that the transac- tion will be consummated.</p><p style="padding-left: 36pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">in September 2004, we completed the sale of Baker Hughes Mining tools (“BHMt”), a product line group within the drilling and evaluation segment that manufactured rotary drill bits used in the mining industry, for $31.5 million.

evidenced by a 14.8% increase in the worldwide rig count, pricing improvements of between four and six percent and increases in market share in selected product lines and geographic areas. these increases were partially offset by the impact of hurricanes in the Gulf</p><p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">of Mexico. Revenues in north america, which accounted for 42.4% of total revenues, increased 20.9% for 2005 compared with 2004, despite the unfavorable impact on our U.S. off- shore revenues of approximately $68.0 million from hurricane- related disruptions. this increase reflects increased activity in the U.S., as evidenced by the 18.0% increase in the north american rig count, with activity dominated by land-based</p><p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">gas-directed drilling. Revenues outside north america, which accounted for 57.6% of total revenues, increased 16.3% for 2005 compared with 2004. this increase reflects the improve- ment in international drilling activity, as evidenced by the 8.6% increase in the rig count outside north america, particularly in Latin america, the Middle east and asia Pacific, coupled with price increases in certain markets and product lines.</p><p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">Revenues for 2004 increased 16.2% compared with 2003, reflecting a 10.1% increase in the worldwide rig count. Reve- nues in north america, which accounted for 41.5% of total revenues, increased 14.4% compared with 2003. this increase reflects increased drilling activity in the U.S. and Canada, as evidenced by a 10.9% increase in the north american rig count, and $24.8 million related to intellectual property license fees, which is not expected to recur in the same magnitude in the future. Revenues outside north america, which accounted for 58.5% of total revenues, increased 17.5% compared with 2003. this increase reflects the improvement in international drilling activity, as evidenced by an 8.6% increase in the rig count outside north america, primarily in Latin america and asia Pacific, partially offset by decreased drilling activity in the north Sea and africa. during 2004, our revenue growth was primarily due to increases in activity and, to a lesser extent, pricing improvements.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Cost of revenues</h4><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">Cost of revenues for 2005 increased 13.6% compared with 2004.

Of this amount, $15.9 million related to the reduction in the carrying value of our equity investment in WesternGeco for which there was no tax benefit. the remaining $20.4 million arose from operations of the ven- ture due to: (i) the venture being taxed in certain foreign juris- dictions based on a deemed profit basis, which is a percentage of revenues rather than profits and (ii) unbenefitted foreign losses of the venture, which are operating losses and impair- ment and restructuring charges in certain foreign jurisdictions where there was no current tax benefit and where a deferred tax asset was not recorded due to the uncertainty of realization.</p><p style="padding-left: 51pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">during 2005 and 2003, benefits of $4.3 million and</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 36pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">$3.3 million, respectively, were recognized as the result of various refund claims filed in the U.S.</p><p style="padding-left: 36pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">Our tax filings for various periods are subjected to audit  by tax authorities in most jurisdictions where we conduct busi- ness. these audits may result in assessments of additional taxes that are resolved with the authorities or potentially through the courts. We believe that these assessments</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">may occasionally be based on erroneous and even arbitrary interpretations of local tax law. We have received tax assess- ments from various taxing authorities and are currently at vary- ing stages of appeals and/or litigation regarding these matters. We have provided for the amounts we believe will ultimately result from these proceedings. We believe we have substantial defenses to the questions being raised and will pursue all legal remedies should an unfavorable outcome result. However, res- olution of these matters involves uncertainties and there are no assurances that the outcomes will be favorable.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Cumulative Effect of accounting Change</h4><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 14pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">On december 31, 2005, we adopted Financial accounting Standards Board (“FaSB”) interpretation no. 47 (“Fin 47”), <i>Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations</i>. Fin 47 clarifies that the term “conditional asset retirement obligation” as used in SFaS no. 143, <i>Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations</i>, refers to a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity in which the timing and/or method of settlement are conditional on a future event that may or may not be within the control of the entity. the adoption of Fin 47 resulted in a charge of $0.9 million, net of tax of $0.5 million, recorded as the cumulative effect of accounting change in the consolidated statement of operations. in conjunction with the adoption, we recorded conditional asset retirement obligations of $1.6 mil- lion as the fair value of the costs associated with the special handling of asbestos related materials in certain facilities. We also have certain facilities that contain asbestos related materi- als for which a liability has not been recognized because the fair value cannot be reasonably estimated. We believe that there are indeterminate settlement dates for these obligations because the range of time over which we would settle these obligations is unknown or cannot be estimated; therefore, suf- ficient information does not exist to apply an expected present value technique.</p><p style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">On January 1, 2003, we adopted SFaS no. 143, <i>Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations</i>. SFaS no. 143 requires that the fair value of a liability associated with an asset retirement obligation (“aRO”) be recognized in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate can be made. the liability for the aRO is revised each subsequent period due to the passage of time and changes in estimates. the associated retirement costs are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the long-lived asset and subsequently depreciated over the esti- mated useful life of the asset. the adoption of SFaS no. 143 in 2003 resulted in a charge of $5.6 million, net of tax of</p><p style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">$2.8 million, recorded as the cumulative effect of accounting change in the consolidated statement of operations. in con- junction with the adoption, we recorded aRO liabilities of</p><p style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">$11.4 million primarily for anticipated costs of obligations associated with the future disposal of power source units at certain of our divisions and refurbishment costs associated with certain leased facilities in europe and with a fleet of leased railcars and tanks.</p><p class="s48" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Liquidity and Capital resources</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">Our objective in financing our business is to maintain adequate financial resources and access to additional liquidity. during 2005, cash flows from operations and proceeds from the issuance of common stock resulting from the exercise of stock options were the principal sources of funding. We antici- pate that cash flows from operations will be sufficient to fund our liquidity needs in 2006. We also have a $500.0 million com- mitted revolving credit facility that provides back-up liquidity in the event an unanticipated and significant demand on cash flows could not be funded by operations.</p><p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">Our capital planning process is focused on utilizing cash flows generated from operations in ways that enhance the value of our company. in 2005, we used cash for a variety of activities including working capital needs, payment of dividends, repurchase of common stock, repayments of borrowings and capital expenditures.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Cash Flows</h4><table style="border-collapse:collapse"

We attribute the increases in our cash flow to the increasing levels of income from continuing operations adjusted for noncash items.</p><p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">Cash flows from operating activities of continuing operations increased $167.8 million in 2005 compared with 2004. this increase was primarily due to an increase in income from con- tinuing operations of $349.1 million partially offset by a change in net operating assets and liabilities that used $180.6 million more in cash flows during 2005 compared with 2004.</p><p

of auction rate securities, which are highly liquid, variable-rate debt securities. While the underlying security has a long-term maturity, the interest rate is reset through dutch auctions that are typically held every 7, 28 or 35 days, creating short-term liquidity. these short-term investments are classified as available-for-sale and are recorded at cost, which approximates market value.</p><p style="padding-left: 51pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">Proceeds from disposal of assets were $90.1 million,</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 36pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">$106.9 million and $66.8 million for 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. these disposals relate to rental tools that were lost-in-hole, as well as machinery, rental tools and equipment no longer used in operations that were sold throughout the year. included in the proceeds for 2004 was $12.2 million related to the sale of certain real estate properties held for sale.</p><p style="padding-left: 36pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">in 2005, we received distributions of $30.0 million from WesternGeco, which were recorded as a reduction in the car- rying value of our investment.

On november 3, 2005, we entered into a Stock Purchase Plan with an agent for the</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">purchase of shares of our common stock that complies with the requirements of Rule 10b5-1 promulgated by the Securi- ties exchange act of 1934. the term of the november Plan will run from november 7, 2005 until april 30, 2006, unless earlier terminated. On February 22, 2006, we entered into another Plan for a term that will run from February 23, 2006 until april 30, 2006, unless earlier terminated. during that term, the agent will use its best efforts to repurchase a fixed dollar value of our common stock each trading day, subject to applicable trading rules, until the cumulative amount pur- chased under the november Plan equals $250.0 million and under the February Plan equals $150.0 million, inclusive of all commissions and fees paid by us to the agent related to such repurchases. Shares will be repurchased by the agent at the prevailing market prices, subject to limitations provided by</p><p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">us, in open market transactions intended to comply with Rule 10b-18 of the exchange act.

However, no shares will be repurchased at any time that the cost of the shares exceeds an amount that</p><p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">has been specified by us to the agent. during the fourth quar- ter of 2005, we repurchased 1.7 million shares of our common stock at an average price of $58.17 per share, for a total</p><p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">of $98.5 million. during 2003, we repurchased 6.3 million shares at an average price of $28.78 per share, for a total of</p><p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">$181.4 million. Upon repurchase, the shares were retired.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 69pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">We paid dividends of $161.1 million, $153.6 million and</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">$154.3 million in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Begin- ning in the fourth quarter of 2005 as authorized by our Board of directors, we increased our quarterly dividend to</p><p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">$0.13 per share, compared to $0.115 per share that was paid in prior quarters.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">available Credit Facilities</h4><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 14pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">at december 31, 2005, we had $955.6 million of credit facilities with commercial banks, of which $500.0 million is a committed revolving credit facility (the “facility”) that expires in July 2010. the facility provides for up to three one-year extensions, subject to the approval and acceptance by the lenders, among other conditions. in addition, the facility con- tains a provision to allow for an increase in the facility amount of an additional $500.0 million, subject to the approval and acceptance by the lenders, among other conditions. the facil- ity contains certain covenants which, among other things, require the maintenance of a funded indebtedness to total capitalization ratio (a defined formula per the facility) of less than or equal to 0.60, restrict certain merger transactions or the sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the company or a significant subsidiary and limit the amount of subsidiary indebtedness. Upon the occurrence of certain events of default, our obligations under the facility may be accelerated. Such events of default include payment defaults to lenders under the facility, covenant defaults and other customary defaults.</p><p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">at december 31, 2005, we were in compliance with all of the facility covenants. there were no direct borrowings under the facility during the year ended december 31, 2005; however, to the extent we have outstanding commercial paper, our ability to borrow under the facility is reduced. at december 31, 2005, we had no outstanding commercial paper.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">if market conditions were to change and revenues were</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">to be significantly reduced or operating costs were to increase, our cash flows and liquidity could be reduced. additionally,</p><p style="padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">it could cause the rating agencies to lower our credit rating. We do not have any ratings triggers in the facility that would accelerate the maturity of any borrowings under the facility. However, a downgrade in our credit ratings could increase the cost of borrowings under the facility and could also limit or preclude our ability to issue commercial paper. Should this occur, we would seek alternative sources of funding, including borrowing under the facility.</p><p style="padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">We believe our credit ratings and relationships with major commercial and investment banks would allow us to obtain interim financing over and above our existing credit facilities for any currently unforeseen significant needs or growth opportunities. We also believe that such interim financings could be funded with subsequent issuances of long-term debt or equity, if necessary.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Cash requirements</h4><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">in 2006, we believe operating cash flows will provide us with sufficient capital resources and liquidity to manage our working capital needs, meet contractual obligations, fund capital expenditures, pay dividends, repurchase common stock and support the development of our short-term and long-term operating strategies.</p><p style="padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">We currently expect 2006 capital expenditures will be between $750.0 million and $780.0 million, excluding acquisi- tions. the expenditures are expected to be used primarily for normal, recurring items necessary to support the growth of our business and operations.</p><p style="padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">in 2006, we expect to make interest payments of between</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">$72.0 million and $77.0 million. this is based on our current expectations of debt levels during 2006. We also expect to make income tax payments of between $490.0 million and</p><p style="padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">$530.0 million in 2006.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">as of december 31, 2005, we have authorization remain- ing to repurchase up to $401.5 million in common stock. We may repurchase our common stock depending on market con- ditions, applicable legal requirements, our liquidity and other considerations. We anticipate paying dividends of between</p><p style="padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">$170.0 million and $180.0 million in 2006; however, the Board of directors can change the dividend policy at anytime.</p><p style="padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">during 2006, we estimate we will contribute between</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">$18.0 million and $23.0 million to our defined benefit pension plans and make benefit payments related to postretirement welfare plans of between $15.0 million and $17.0 million.</p><p style="padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">We also estimate we will contribute between $85.0 million and $95.0 million to our defined contribution plans.</p><p style="padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">We do not believe there are any other material trends, demands, commitments, events or uncertainties that would have, or are reasonably likely to have, a material impact on our financial condition and liquidity. Other than previously dis- cussed, we currently have no information that would create a reasonable likelihood that the reported levels of revenues and cash flows from operations in 2005 are not indicative of what we can expect in the future.</p><h4 style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 36pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Contractual obligations</h4><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 36pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">in the table below, we set forth our contractual cash obligations as of december 31, 2005. Some of the figures we include in this table are based on our estimates and assumptions about these obligations, including their duration, anticipated actions by third parties and other factors. the contractual cash obligations we will actually pay in future periods may vary from those reflected in the table because the estimates and assumptions are subjective.</p><p style="text-indent:

SFaS no. 151 requires that these items be recognized as current period charges. in addition, SFaS no. 151 requires the allocation of fixed production</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">overheads to inventory based on the normal capacity of the production facilities. SFaS no. 151 is effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2005. We adopted SFaS no. 151 on January 1, 2006, with no mate- rial effect on our consolidated financial statements.</p><p style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">in december 2004, the FaSB issued the revised SFaS no.123, <i>Share-Based Payment </i>(“SFaS no. 123(R)”). SFaS no. 123(R) is a revision of SFaS no. 123 and supersedes aPB no. 25. SFaS no. 123(R) requires an entity to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instru- ments based on the grant-date fair value of the award. that cost will be recognized over the period in which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award. SFaS no. 123(R) also requires an entity to initially measure the cost of employee services rendered in exchange for an award of lia- bility instruments at its current fair value. the fair value of that award is to be remeasured subsequently at each reporting date through the settlement date. Changes in the fair value during the required service period are to be recognized as compensa- tion cost over that period. in accordance with guidance issued by the SeC that delayed the effective date of SFaS no. 123(R), we adopted SFaS no. 123(R) on January 1, 2006 using the modified prospective method, whereby we will recognize expense on any previously granted unvested awards over the remaining service period of the award. new awards granted after the adoption date will be expensed over the estimated</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">service period. Based on our current estimates, we expect the impact in 2006 of the adoption of SFaS no. 123(R) to be addi- tional expense of between $18.0 million and $20.0 million, net of tax. We are continuing to evaluate the various option pricing models and the required assumptions and estimates that will be used in determining the fair value of awards made in 2006. in addition, we have estimated the number of awards to be granted in 2006 because the final amount has not been determined. as a result, the actual amount recorded as expense in 2006 may be different from this estimated amount and this estimated amount may not be indicative of the expense we may incur in future years.</p><p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">in december 2004, the FaSB issued FaSB Staff Position no. 109-1 (“FSP 109-1”), <i>Application of FASB Statement No. 109, “Accounting for Income Taxes” (“SFAS No. 109”) to</i></p><p class="s50" style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">the Tax Deduction on Qualified Production Activities Provided by the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004<span class="p">, which provides guidance on the american Jobs Creation act of 2004 (the “act”). the act provides a tax deduction for income from qualified domestic production activities. FSP 109-1 provides for the treatment of the deduction as a special deduction as described in SFaS no. 109. as such, the deduction will have no effect on existing deferred tax assets and liabilities. the impact of the deduction is to be reported in the period in which the deduction is claimed on our U.S. tax return. We adopted FSP 109-1 on January 1, 2005, with no material impact on our 2005 effective tax rate, and we do not expect</span></p><p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">that this deduction will have a material impact on our effective tax rate in future years.</p><p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">in december 2004, the FaSB issued FaSB Staff Position no. 109-2 (“FSP 109-2”), <i>Accounting and Disclosure Guidance for the Foreign Repatriation Provision within the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004</i>, which provides guidance under SFaS no. 109 with respect to recording the potential impact</p><p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">of the repatriation provisions of the act on a company’s income tax expense and deferred tax liability. FSP 109-2 states that a company is allowed time beyond the financial reporting period of enactment to evaluate the effect of the act on its plan for reinvestment or repatriation of foreign earnings for purposes of applying SFaS no. 109. We have decided not to elect to repatriate foreign earnings under the provisions in the act. accordingly, our consolidated financial statements do not reflect a provision for taxes related to this election.</p><p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">in March 2005, the FaSB issued FaSB interpretation no. 47 (“Fin 47”), <i>Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obli- gations</i>. Fin 47 clarifies that the term “conditional asset retire- ment obligation” as used in SFaS no. 143, <i>Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations</i>, refers to a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity in which the timing and/or method of settlement are conditional on a future event that may or may not be within the control of the entity. We adopted Fin 47 on december 31, 2005, which resulted in a charge of</p><p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">$0.9 million, net of tax of $0.5 million, recorded as the cumula- tive effect of accounting change in the consolidated statement of operations. in conjunction with the adoption, we recorded conditional asset retirement obligations of $1.6 million as the fair value of the costs associated with certain conditional asset retirement obligations.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">in May 2005, the FaSB issued SFaS no. 154, <i>Accounting Changes and Error Corrections</i>. SFaS no. 154 replaces accounting Principles Board Opinion no. 20 (“aPB no. 20”), <i>Accounting Changes, and SFAS No. 3, Reporting Accounting Changes in Interim Financial Statements</i>, and changes the requirements for the accounting for and reporting of a change in accounting principle. SFaS no. 154 requires retrospective application of changes in accounting principle to prior periods’ financial statements, unless it is impracticable to determine either the period-specific effects or the cumulative effect of the change. SFaS no. 154 is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after decem- ber 15, 2005. We adopted SFaS no. 154 on January 1, 2006.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s48" style="padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">related Party Transactions</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">in conjunction with the formation of WesternGeco in november 2000, we entered into an agreement with Schlum- berger whereby a cash true-up payment was to be made by either of the parties based on a formula comparing the ratio of the net present value of sales revenue from each party’s contributed multiclient seismic data libraries during the four- year period ending november 30, 2004 and the ratio of the net book value of those libraries as of november 30, 2000. the maximum payment that either party would be required to make as a result of this adjustment was $100.0 million. in august 2005, we received $13.3 million from Schlumberger related to the true-up payment.

Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide rea- sonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Our control environment is the foundation for our system of internal con- trol and is embodied in our Business Code of Conduct, which sets the tone of our company and includes our Core Values of integ- rity, teamwork, Performance and Learning. included in our system of internal control are written policies, an organizational structure providing division of responsibilities, the selection and training of qualified personnel and a program of financial and operations reviews by a professional staff of internal auditors. Our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and proce- dures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of our financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expendi- tures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and</p><p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">(iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.</p><p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting.

Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be pre- vented or detected on a timely basis. also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.</p><p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">Our management’s assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of december 31, 2005 has been audited by deloitte &amp; touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which is included herein.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s85" style="padding-left: 50pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="201" height="33" alt="image" src="NYSE_BHI_2005/Image_070.gif"/></span>	<span><img width="194" height="47" alt="image" src="NYSE_BHI_2005/Image_071.gif"/></span>	<span><img width="187" height="50" alt="image" src="NYSE_BHI_2005/Image_072.gif"/></span></p><p class="s86" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: left;">Chad C. deaton Chairman and</p><p class="s86" style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Chief executive Officer</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">Houston, texas February 23, 2006</p><p class="s86" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 35pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: left;">G.

In the Notes to Consolidated Financial State- ments, all dollar and share amounts in tabulations are in millions of dollars and shares, respectively, unless otherwise indicated.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 36pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Use of estimates</h4><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 36pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and judg- ments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabili- ties, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of reve- nues and expenses during the reporting period. We base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on vari- ous other assumptions and information that are believed to</p><p style="padding-left: 36pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">be reasonable under the circumstances. Estimates and assump- tions about future events and their effects cannot be perceived with certainty and, accordingly, these estimates may change as new events occur, as more experience is acquired, as additional information is obtained and as our operating environment changes. While we believe that the estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the consolidated financial state- ments are appropriate, actual results could differ from those estimates. Estimates are used for, but are not limited to, deter- mining the following: allowance for doubtful accounts and inventory valuation reserves, recoverability of long-lived assets, useful lives used in depreciation and amortization, income taxes and related valuation allowances and insurance, environmental, legal and pensions and postretirement benefit obligations.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 36pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Revenue Recognition</h4><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 36pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">Our products and services are generally sold based upon purchase orders or contracts with the customer that include fixed or determinable prices and that do not include right of return or other similar provisions or other significant post- delivery obligations. Our products are produced in a standard</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">manufacturing operation, even if produced to our customer’s specifications, and are sold in the ordinary course of business through our regular marketing channels. We recognize reve- nue for these products upon delivery, when title passes and when collectibility is reasonably assured. Provisions for esti- mated warranty returns or similar types of items are made at the time the related revenue is recognized. Revenue for ser- vices is recognized as the services are rendered and when col- lectibility is reasonably assured. Rates for services are typically priced on a per day, per meter, per man hour or similar basis.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Cash equivalents</h4><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">We consider all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less at the time of purchase to be cash equivalents.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">short-term investments</h4><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">During 2005, we began investing in auction rate securities, which are highly liquid, variable-rate debt securities. While the underlying security has a long-term maturity, the interest rate is reset through Dutch auctions that are typically held every</p><p style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">7, 28 or 35 days, creating short-term liquidity. The securities trade at par and are callable at par on any interest payment date at the option of the issuer. Interest is paid at the end of each auction period. We limit our investments in auction rate securities to securities that carry a AAA (or equivalent) rating from a recognized rating agency. The investments are classified as available-for-sale and are recorded at cost, which approxi- mates market value.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">inventories</h4><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">Cost is determined using the first-in, first-out (“FIFO”) method or the average cost method, which approximates FIFO, and includes the cost of materials, labor and manufac- turing overhead.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Property and depreciation</h4><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">Property is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation, which is generally provided by using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the individual assets. We manufacture a substantial portion of our rental tools and equipment and the cost of these items, which includes direct and indirect manufacturing costs, are capitalized and carried in inventory until the tool is completed. Once the tool has been completed, the cost of the tool is reflected in capital expendi- tures and the tool is classified as rental tools and equipment in property. Significant improvements and betterments are capi- talized if they extend the useful life of the asset.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Goodwill, intangible assets and amortization</h4><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">Goodwill, including goodwill associated with equity method investments, and intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized. Intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortized either on a straight-line basis over the</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">asset’s estimated useful life or on a basis that reflects the pat- tern in which the economic benefits of the intangible assets are realized.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">impairment of long-lived assets</h4><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">We review property, intangible assets and certain other assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circum- stances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recover- able. The determination of recoverability is made based upon the estimated undiscounted future net cash flows, excluding interest expense. The amount of impairment loss, if any, is determined by comparing the fair value, as determined by a discounted cash flow analysis, with the carrying value of the related assets.</p><p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">We perform an annual impairment test of goodwill for each of our reporting units as of October 1, or more fre- quently if circumstances indicate an impairment may exist. Our reporting units are based on our organizational and reporting structure. Corporate and other assets and liabilities are allo- cated to the reporting units to the extent that they relate to the operations of those reporting units in determining their carrying amount. Investments in affiliates are also reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indi- cate that impairment may exist. The determination of impair- ment is made by comparing the carrying amount with its fair value, which is calculated using a combination of a market capitalization and discounted cash flow approach.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">income taxes</h4><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">We use the liability method for determining our income taxes, under which current and deferred tax liabilities and assets are recorded in accordance with enacted tax laws and rates. Under this method, the amounts of deferred tax liabili- ties and assets at the end of each period are determined using the tax rate expected to be in effect when taxes are actually paid or recovered. Future tax benefits are recognized to the extent that realization of such benefits is more likely than not.</p><p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">Deferred income taxes are provided for the estimated income tax effect of temporary differences between financial and tax bases in assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets are also provided for certain tax credit carryforwards. A valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets is established when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.</p><p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">We intend to indefinitely reinvest certain earnings of our foreign subsidiaries in operations outside the U.S., and accord- ingly, we have not provided for U.S. income taxes on such earnings. We do provide for the U.S. and additional non-U.S. taxes on earnings anticipated to be repatriated from our non-</p><p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">U.S. subsidiaries.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">We operate in more than 90 countries under many legal forms. As a result, we are subject to the jurisdiction of numer- ous domestic and foreign tax authorities, as well as to tax agreements and treaties among these governments. Our oper- ations in these different jurisdictions are taxed on various bases: actual income before taxes, deemed profits (which are generally determined using a percentage of revenues rather</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 25pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">than profits) and withholding taxes based on revenue. Deter- mination of taxable income in any jurisdiction requires the interpretation of the related tax laws and regulations and the use of estimates and assumptions regarding significant future events, such as the amount, timing and character of deduc- tions, permissible revenue recognition methods under the tax law and the sources and character of income and tax credits. Changes in tax laws, regulations, agreements and treaties, for- eign currency exchange restrictions or our level of operations or profitability in each taxing jurisdiction could have an impact upon the amount of income taxes that we provide during any given year.</p><p style="padding-left: 25pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">Our tax filings for various periods are subjected to audit by tax authorities in most jurisdictions where we conduct business. These audits may result in assessments of additional taxes that are resolved with the authorities or potentially through the courts. We believe that these assessments may occasionally be based on erroneous and even arbitrary inter- pretations of local tax law. We have received tax assessments from various taxing authorities and are currently at varying stages of appeals and/or litigation regarding these matters.</p><p style="padding-left: 25pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">We have provided for the amounts we believe will ultimately result from these proceedings. We believe we have substantial defenses to the questions being raised and will pursue all legal remedies should an unfavorable outcome result. However, res- olution of these matters involves uncertainties and there are no assurances that the outcomes will be favorable.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 25pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Product Warranties</h4><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 25pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">We sell certain products with a product warranty that pro- vides that customers can return a defective product during a specified warranty period following the purchase in exchange for a replacement product, repair at no cost to the customer or the issuance of a credit to the customer. We accrue amounts for estimated warranty claims based upon current and historical product sales data, warranty costs incurred</p><p style="padding-left: 25pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">and any other related information known to us.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 25pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">environmental matters</h4><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 25pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">Remediation costs are accrued based on estimates of known environmental remediation exposure using currently available facts, existing environmental permits, technology and presently enacted laws and regulations. For sites where we are primarily responsible for the remediation, our cost estimates are developed based on internal evaluations and are not dis- counted. Such accruals are recorded when it is probable that we will be obligated to pay for environmental site evaluation, remediation or related activities, and such costs can be reason- ably estimated. If the obligation can only be estimated within a range, we accrue the minimum amount in the range. Such accruals are recorded even if significant uncertainties exist over the ultimate cost of the remediation. As additional or more accurate information becomes available, accruals are adjusted to reflect current cost estimates. Ongoing environmental com- pliance costs, such as obtaining environmental permits, instal- lation of pollution control equipment and waste disposal, are</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 36pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">expensed as incurred. Where we have been identified as a potentially responsible party in a United States federal or state “Superfund” site, we accrue our share of the estimated reme- diation costs of the site. This share is based on the ratio of the estimated volume of waste we contributed to the site to the total volume of waste disposed at the site.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 36pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Foreign Currency</h4><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 36pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">The majority of our significant foreign subsidiaries have designated the local currency as their functional currency and, as such, gains and losses resulting from balance sheet translation of foreign operations are included as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive loss within stockholders’ equity. Gains and losses from foreign currency transactions, such as those resulting from the settlement of receivables or payables in the non-functional currency, are included in selling, general and administrative (“SG&amp;A”) expense in the consolidated statements of operations as incurred. For those foreign subsidiaries that have designated the U.S. Dollar as the functional currency, gains and losses resulting from balance sheet translation of foreign operations are also included in SG&amp;A expense in the consolidated state- ments of operations as incurred. We recorded net foreign</p><p style="padding-left: 36pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">currency transaction and translation gains in SG&amp;A in the con- solidated statement of operations of $6.8 million, $4.0 million and $1.5 million in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 36pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">derivative Financial instruments</h4><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 36pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">We monitor our exposure to various business risks includ- ing commodity price, foreign currency exchange rate and interest rate risks and occasionally use derivative financial instruments to manage the impact of certain of these risks. Our policies do not permit the use of derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes. We use foreign currency forward contracts to hedge certain firm commitments and transactions denominated in foreign currencies. We use inter- est rate swaps to manage interest rate risk.</p><p style="padding-left: 36pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">At the inception of any new derivative, we designate the derivative as a cash flow or fair value hedge or we determine the derivative to be undesignated as a hedging instrument as the facts dictate. We document all relationships between the hedging instruments and the hedged items, as well as our risk management objectives and strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions. We assess whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows of the hedged item at both the incep- tion of the hedge and on an ongoing basis.</p><h4 style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 25pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">stock-Based Compensation</h4><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 25pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">As allowed under Statement of Financial Accounting Stan- dards (“SFAS”) No. 123, <i>Accounting for Stock-Based Compen- sation</i>, we account for compensation related to stock options and our employee stock purchase plan using the intrinsic value method of accounting in accordance with Accounting Princi- ples Board Opinion No. 25 (“APB No. 25”), <i>Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees</i>. Under this method, compensation expense is recognized only for the difference between the quoted market price of the stock at the measurement date less the amount, if any, the employee is required to pay for the stock. Our reported net income does not include any compen- sation expense associated with our employee stock purchase plan or with stock option awards because the exercise prices of our stock option awards equal the market prices of the underlying stock when granted and because our employee stock purchase plan is non compensatory. Our reported net income does include compensation expense associated with restricted stock awards.</p><p style="padding-left: 25pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued the revised SFAS No. 123, <i>Share-Based Payment </i>(“SFAS No. 123(R)”). SFAS No. 123(R) is a revision of SFAS No. 123 and supersedes APB No. 25. SFAS No. 123(R) requires an entity to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant-date fair value of the award. That cost will be recognized over the period in which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award. SFAS No. 123(R) also requires an entity to initially measure the cost of employee services rendered in exchange for an award of liability instru- ments at its current fair value with the fair value remeasured at each subsequent reporting date through the settlement date. Changes in the fair value during the required service period are to be recognized as compensation cost over that period.</p><p style="padding-left: 25pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">SFAS No. 123(R) clarified the accounting in SFAS No. 123 related to estimating the service period for employees that are or become retirement eligible during the vesting period, requiring that the recognition of compensation expense for these employees be accelerated. This impacts the timing of expense recognition, but not the total expense to be recog- nized over the vesting period. In the first quarter of 2005,</p><p style="padding-left: 25pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">we adopted this new methodology on a prospective basis.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 25pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">The cumulative effect of this clarification is $11.8 million, net of tax, which, for purposes of calculating the pro forma disclo- sure, is included in our pro forma disclosure for stock-based compensation below for the year ended December 31, 2005.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">If we had recognized compensation expense by applying the fair value based method to all awards as provided for under SFAS No. 123, our pro forma net income, earnings per share (“EPS”) and stock-based compensation cost would have been as follows for the years ended December 31:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s62" style="padding-bottom: 1pt;padding-left: 169pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">2005 2004 2003</p><p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="326" height="1" alt="image" src="NYSE_BHI_2005/Image_075.png"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">Net income, as reported $ 878.4 $ 528.6 $ 128.9 Add: Stock-based</p><p style="padding-left: 59pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">compensation for restricted stock awards included in reported</p><p style="padding-left: 60pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">net income, net of tax 6.1 1.6 1.9</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 59pt;text-indent: -6pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">Deduct: Stock-based compensation deter- mined under the fair value method,</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="325" height="1" alt="image" src="NYSE_BHI_2005/Image_076.png"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="325" height="1" alt="image" src="NYSE_BHI_2005/Image_077.png"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 6pt;line-height: 145%;text-align: left;">net of tax (35.0) (23.1) (23.1) Pro forma net income $ 849.5 $ 507.1 $ 107.7</p><p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Basic EPS</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 60pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">As reported $ 2.59 $ 1.58 $ 0.38</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 60pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Pro forma 2.50 1.52 0.32</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Diluted EPS</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 59pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">As reported $ 2.57 $ 1.58 $ 0.38</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 60pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Pro forma 2.49 1.51 0.32</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">Under SFAS No. 123, the fair value of stock-based awards is calculated through the use of option pricing models. These models require a number of subjective assumptions and esti- mates which can significantly affect the calculated values.</p><p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">These include future stock price volatility, expected time to exercise, discount rates, forfeiture rates and employee turnover rates. In addition, the number of awards granted impacts the amount of expense. As a result, the above pro forma amounts may not be indicative of future amounts. The above proforma calculations were made using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following weighted average assumptions for the years ended December 31:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s62" style="padding-bottom: 1pt;padding-left: 205pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Assumptions</p><p style="padding-left: 158pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="184" height="0" alt="image" src="NYSE_BHI_2005/Image_078.png"/></span></p><p class="s62" style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 157pt;text-indent: 71pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: left;">Risk-Free Expected Dividend Expected Interest Life</p><p class="s62" style="padding-bottom: 1pt;padding-left: 231pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">Yield           Volatility            Rate           (In years)</p><p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="321" height="1" alt="image" src="NYSE_BHI_2005/Image_079.png"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">2005 1.0% 35.0% 3.7% 3.7</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">2004 1.3% 39.9% 2.8% 3.5</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">2003 1.6% 45.0% 2.5% 3.8</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">The weighted average fair values of options granted in 2005, 2004 and 2003 were $14.62, $11.16 and $10.25 per share, respectively.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">In accordance with guidance issued by the SEC that delayed the effective date, we adopted SFAS No. 123(R) on January 1, 2006 using the modified prospective method</p><p style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">whereby we will recognize expense on any previously granted unvested awards over the remaining service period of the award.

We are continuing to evaluate the various option pricing models and the required assumptions and estimates that will be used in determining the fair value of awards made in 2006. In addition, we have estimated the number of awards to be granted in 2006 because the final amount has not been determined.

SFAS No. 151 requires that these items be recognized as current period charges. In addition, SFAS No. 151 requires the allocation of fixed production over- heads to inventory based on the normal capacity of the pro- duction facilities. SFAS No. 151 was effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2005. We adopted SFAS No. 151 on January 1, 2006 with no material impact on our consolidated financial statements.</p><p style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">In December 2004, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position No. 109-1 (“FSP 109-1”), <i>Application of FASB Statement No. 109, “Accounting for Income Taxes” (“SFAS No. 109”) to</i></p><p class="s50" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">the Tax Deduction on Qualified Production Activities Provided by the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004<span class="p">, which provides guidance on the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (the “Act”). The Act provides a tax deduction for income from qualified domestic production activities. FSP 109-1 provides for the treatment of the deduction as a special deduction as described in SFAS No. 109. As such, the deduction will have no effect on existing deferred tax assets and liabilities. The impact of the deduction is to be reported in the period in which the deduction is claimed on our U.S. tax return. We adopted FSP 109-1 on January 1, 2005, with no material impact on our 2005 effective tax rate, and we do not expect</span></p><p style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">that this deduction will have a material impact on our effective tax rate in future years.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 36pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">In December 2004, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position No. 109-2 (“FSP 109-2”), <i>Accounting and Disclosure Guidance for the Foreign Repatriation Provision within the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004</i>, which provides guidance under SFAS No. 109 with respect to recording the potential impact of the repatriation provisions of the Act on a company’s income tax expense and deferred tax liability. FSP 109-2 states that a company is allowed time beyond the financial reporting period of enactment to evaluate the effect of the Act on its plan for reinvestment or repatriation of foreign earnings for purposes of applying SFAS No. 109. We have decided not to elect to repatriate foreign earnings under the provisions in the Act. Accordingly, our consolidated financial statements do not reflect a provision for taxes related to this election.</p><p style="padding-left: 36pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">In March 2005, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 47 (“FIN 47”), <i>Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obli- gations</i>. FIN 47 clarifies that the term “conditional asset retire- ment obligation” as used in SFAS No. 143, <i>Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations</i>, refers to a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity in which the timing and/or method of settlement are conditional on a future event that may or may not be within the control of the entity. The obliga- tion to perform the asset retirement activity is unconditional even though uncertainty exists about the timing and/or method of settlement. FIN 47 also clarifies when an entity would have sufficient information to reasonably estimate</p><p style="padding-left: 36pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">the fair value of an asset retirement obligation. We adopted FIN 47 on December 31, 2005, which resulted in a charge of</p><p style="padding-left: 36pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">$0.9 million, net of tax of $0.5 million, recorded as the cumu- lative effect of accounting change in the consolidated state- ment of operations. In conjunction with the adoption, we recorded conditional asset retirement obligations of $1.6 mil- lion as the fair value of the costs associated with certain condi- tional asset retirement obligations.</p><p style="padding-left: 36pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">In May 2005, the FASB issued SFAS No. 154, <i>Accounting Changes and Error Corrections</i>. SFAS No. 154 replaces Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 20 (“APB No. 20”), <i>Accounting Changes</i>, and SFAS No. 3, <i>Reporting Accounting Changes in Interim Financial Statements</i>, and changes the requirements for the accounting for and reporting of a change in accounting principle. SFAS No. 154 requires retrospective application of changes in accounting principle to prior periods’ financial statements, unless it is impracticable to determine either the period-specific effects or the cumulative effect of the change. SFAS No. 154 is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after Decem- ber 15, 2005. We adopted SFAS No. 154 on January 1, 2006.</p><p class="s48" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Note 2. discontinued operations</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">In the fourth quarter of 2005, our management initiated and our Board of Directors approved a plan to sell the Baker Supply Products Division (“SPD”), a product line group within the Completion and Production segment. SPD distributes basic supplies, products and small tools to the drilling industry. In January 2006, we signed a non-binding letter of intent for the sale of SPD. The sale is expected to close in the first quarter of 2006. This transaction is subject to the negotiation and execu- tion of a definitive sale agreement, as well as, various condi- tions, including satisfactory due diligence review of SPD’s business. There can be no assurance that the transaction will be consummated.</p><p style="padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">In September 2004, we completed the sale of Baker Hughes Mining Tools (“BHMT”), a product line group within the Drilling and Evaluation segment that manufactured rotary drill bits used in the mining industry, for $31.5 million. We recorded a gain on the sale of $0.2 million, net of tax of</p><p style="padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">$3.6 million, which consisted of a gain on the disposal of</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">$6.8 million offset by a loss of $6.6 million related to the recognition of the cumulative foreign currency translation adjustments into earnings.</p><p style="padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">In October 2003, we signed a definitive agreement for the sale of BIRD Machine (“BIRD”), the remaining division of the former Process segment, and recorded charges totaling</p><p style="padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">$37.4 million, net of tax of $10.9 million, which consisted of</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">a loss of $13.5 million on the write-down of BIRD to fair value,</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">$6.2 million of severance and warranty accruals and a loss of</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">$17.7 million related to the recognition of cumulative foreign currency translation adjustments into earnings. In January 2004, we completed the sale of BIRD and recorded an addi- tional loss on the sale of $0.5 million with no tax benefit. We received $5.6 million in proceeds, which were subject to post- closing adjustments to the purchase price, and retained certain accounts receivable, inventories and other assets. During the second quarter of 2004, we made a net payment of $6.8 mil- lion to the buyer in settlement of the final purchase price adjustments. The adjustments were the result of changes in the value of assets sold to and liabilities assumed by the buyer between the date the initial sales price was negotiated and the closing of the sale.</p><p style="padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">In December 2002, we entered into exclusive negotiations for the sale of our interest in our oil producing operations in West Africa and received $10.0 million as a deposit. The trans- action was effective as of January 1, 2003, and resulted in</p><p style="padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">a gain on the sale of $4.1 million, net of a tax benefit of</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">$0.2 million. We received the remaining $22.0 million in proceeds in April 2003.</p><p style="padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">In 2003, all purchase price adjustments related to the sale of EIMCO Process Equipment (“EIMCO”) were completed, resulting in the release of the escrow balance, of which we received $2.0 million and $2.9 million was returned to the buyer. We recorded an additional loss on the sale of EIMCO of $2.5 million, net of tax of $1.3 million.</p><table style="border-collapse:collapse" cellspacing="0"><tr style="height:9pt"><td style="width:113pt;border-bottom-style:solid;border-bottom-width:1pt;border-bottom-color:#231F20"><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p></td><td style="width:41pt;border-bottom-style:solid;border-bottom-width:1pt;border-bottom-color:#231F20"><p class="s52" style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 7pt;text-align: left;">2005</p></td><td style="width:42pt;border-bottom-style:solid;border-bottom-width:1pt;border-bottom-color:#231F20"><p class="s52" style="padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 7pt;text-align: left;">2004</p></td><td style="width:48pt;border-bottom-style:solid;border-bottom-width:1pt;border-bottom-color:#231F20"><p class="s52" style="padding-left: 14pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 7pt;text-align: left;">2003</p></td></tr><tr style="height:14pt"><td style="width:113pt;border-top-style:solid;border-top-width:1pt;border-top-color:#231F20"><p class="s49" style="padding-top: 2pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Revenues:</p></td><td style="width:41pt;border-top-style:solid;border-top-width:1pt;border-top-color:#231F20"><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p></td><td style="width:42pt;border-top-style:solid;border-top-width:1pt;border-top-color:#231F20"><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p></td><td style="width:48pt;border-top-style:solid;border-top-width:1pt;border-top-color:#231F20"><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p></td></tr><tr style="height:12pt"><td style="width:113pt"><p class="s49" style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">SPD</p></td><td style="width:41pt"><p class="s49" style="padding-right: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: right;">$ 32.5</p></td><td style="width:42pt"><p class="s49" style="padding-right: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: right;">$ 24.2</p></td><td style="width:48pt"><p class="s49" style="padding-right: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: right;">$ 19.1</p></td></tr><tr style="height:12pt"><td style="width:113pt"><p class="s49" style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">BHMT</p></td><td style="width:41pt"><p class="s49" style="padding-right: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: right;">–</p></td><td style="width:42pt"><p class="s49" style="padding-right: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: right;">29.4</p></td><td style="width:48pt"><p class="s49" style="padding-right: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: right;">40.4</p></td></tr><tr style="height:12pt"><td style="width:113pt"><p class="s49" style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">BIRD</p></td><td style="width:41pt"><p class="s49" style="padding-right: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: right;">–</p></td><td style="width:42pt"><p class="s49" style="padding-right: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: right;">1.6</p></td><td style="width:48pt"><p class="s49" style="padding-right: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: right;">94.2</p></td></tr><tr style="height:12pt"><td style="width:113pt;border-bottom-style:solid;border-bottom-width:1pt;border-bottom-color:#231F20"><p class="s49" style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Oil producing operations</p></td><td style="width:41pt;border-bottom-style:solid;border-bottom-width:1pt;border-bottom-color:#231F20"><p class="s49" style="padding-right: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: right;">–</p></td><td style="width:42pt;border-bottom-style:solid;border-bottom-width:1pt;border-bottom-color:#231F20"><p class="s49" style="padding-right: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: right;">–</p></td><td style="width:48pt;border-bottom-style:solid;border-bottom-width:1pt;border-bottom-color:#231F20"><p class="s49" style="padding-right: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: right;">4.2</p></td></tr></table><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">We have reclassified the consolidated financial statements for all prior periods presented to reflect these operations as dis- continued.

million in cash, which is included in the Completion and Production segment. As a result of the acqui- sition and based on preliminary estimates of fair values, we recorded approximately $19.5 million of goodwill and intangi- ble assets, which may be revised based on the final purchase price allocations. The purchase price was preliminarily allocated based on the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the acquisition. Pro forma results of the operations have not been presented because the effects of the acquisition were not material to our consolidated financial statements.</p><p style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">Under the terms of the Purchase Agreement, the former own- ers of Zertech are entitled to additional purchase price consid- eration of up to approximately $14.0 million based on the performance of the business during 2006, 2007 and 2008.</p><p style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">In 2003, we obtained a 50% interest in the QuantX Well- bore Instrumentation venture (“QuantX”), which is engaged in permanent in-well monitoring. Through August 2005, we accounted for our ownership in QuantX using the equity method of accounting. In August 2005, we exercised our right to acquire the remaining 50% interest in QuantX and began to consolidate QuantX’s accounts and discontinued using the equity method of accounting. In October 2005, we finalized the purchase of the remaining 50% interest in QuantX for</p><p style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">$27.2 million, subject to final purchase price adjustments. Based on our carrying value of our existing investment in QuantX of $35.5 million and the additional consideration of</p><p style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">$27.2 million, we recorded approximately $28.4 million of goodwill and $19.6 million of intangibles. We also assigned</p><p style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">$5.1 million to in-process research and development that was written off in October 2005 at the date of acquisition. This write-off is included in research and development expenses, which are included in cost of revenues in the consolidated statement of operations. The purchase price was allocated based on the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed of QuantX. The fair values were determined using a discounted cash flow approach. Pro forma results of opera- tions have not been presented because the effect of this acquisition was not material to our consolidated financial statements. QuantX is included in the Completion and Production segment.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 36pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">In 2002, we entered into a venture, Luna Energy, L.L.C. (“Luna”), in which we had a 40% interest and that we accounted for using the equity method of accounting. In December 2004, we acquired the remaining 60% interest in Luna for $1.0 million in cash. As a result of the acquisition,</p><p style="padding-left: 36pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">we have recorded approximately $19.0 million of goodwill and</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 36pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">$5.5 million of intangible assets. We also assigned $1.8 million to in-process research and development that was written off at the date of acquisition. This write-off is included in research and development expenses, which are included in cost of reve- nues in the consolidated statement of operations. The pur- chase price was allocated based on the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed of Luna. The fair values were determined using a discounted cash flow approach.

Luna is included in the Completion and Production segment.</p><p style="padding-left: 36pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">In 2003, we made two acquisitions having an aggregate purchase price of $16.9 million, of which $9.5 million was paid in cash. As a result of these acquisitions, we recorded approximately $3.9 million of goodwill and $9.6 million of intangible assets. The purchase price was allocated based on the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in each of these acquisitions. Pro forma results of operations</p><p style="padding-left: 36pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">have not been presented because the effects of these acquisi- tions were not material to our consolidated financial state- ments on either an individual or aggregate basis.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s48" style="padding-left: 36pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Note 4.

In addition, the facility contains a pro- vision to allow for an increase in the facility amount of an addi- tional $500.0 million, subject to the approval and acceptance by the lenders, among other conditions.

Such events of default include payment defaults to lenders under the facility, covenant defaults and other customary defaults. At Decem- ber 31, 2005, we were in compliance with all of the facility covenants. There were no direct borrowings under the facility during the year ended December 31, 2005; however, to the extent we have outstanding commercial paper, our ability to borrow under the facility is reduced.

This agreement had been designated and had qualified as a fair value hedging instru- ment. Upon termination we were required to pay $5.5 million. This amount is being amortized as an increase to interest expense over the remaining life of the underlying debt secu- rity, which matures in January 2009.</p><p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">In April 2004, we entered into an interest rate swap agree- ment for a notional amount of $325.0 million associated with our 6.25% Notes due January 2009.

The interest rate swap agreement was fully effective, resulting in no gain or loss recorded in the consoli- dated statement of operations. We recorded the fair value of the interest rate swap agreement, which was a $2.3 million liability at December 31, 2004, based on quoted market prices for contracts with similar terms and maturity dates.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Foreign Currency Forward Contracts</h4><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">At December 31, 2005, we had entered into several foreign currency forward contracts with notional amounts aggregating $65.0 million to hedge exposure to currency fluctuations in various foreign currency payables and receiv- ables, including the British Pound Sterling, the Norwegian Krone, the Euro and the Brazilian Real. These contracts are designated and qualify as fair value hedging instruments.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">Based on quoted market prices as of December 31, 2005 for contracts with similar terms and maturity dates, we recorded a gain of $0.1 million to adjust these foreign currency forward contracts to their fair market value. This gain offsets desig- nated foreign exchange losses resulting from the underlying</p><p style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">exposures and is included in selling, general and administrative expense in the consolidated statement of operations.</p><p style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">At December 31, 2004, we had entered into several foreign currency forward contracts with notional amounts aggregating $78.0 million to hedge exposure to currency fluc- tuations in various foreign currency payables and receivables, including the British Pound Sterling, the Norwegian Krone, the Euro and the Brazilian Real. These contracts were designated and qualified as fair value hedging instruments. Based on quoted market prices as of December 31, 2004, for contracts with similar terms and maturity dates, we recorded a loss of</p><p style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">$0.4 million to adjust these foreign currency forward contracts to their fair market value. This loss offsets designated foreign exchange gains resulting from the underlying exposures and</p><p style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">is included in selling, general and administrative expense in the consolidated statement of operations.</p><p style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">At December 31, 2004, we had also entered into several foreign currency forward contracts with notional amounts aggregating $122.4 million to hedge exposure to currency fluctuations in various foreign currencies, including the British Pound Sterling and the Canadian Dollar. These exposures arise when local currency operating expenses are not in balance with local currency revenue collections. The funding of such imbalances was supported by short-term intercompany bor- rowing commitments that had definitive amounts and funding dates. All funding took place before December 31, 2005. These foreign currency forward contracts were designated as cash flow hedging instruments and were fully effective. Based on quoted market prices as of December 31, 2004, for contracts with similar terms and maturity dates, we recorded a loss of</p><p style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">$0.1 million to adjust these foreign currency forward contracts to their fair market value. The loss was recorded in other com- prehensive income in the consolidated balance sheet.</p><p style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">Additionally, during 2005 and 2004, we entered into and settled foreign currency forward contracts to hedge exposure to currency fluctuations for specific transactions or balances. The impact on our consolidated statements of operations was not significant for these contracts either individually or  in the aggregate.</p><p style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">The counterparties to our foreign currency forward con- tracts are major financial institutions. The credit ratings and concentration of risk of these financial institutions are moni- tored on a continuing basis. In the unlikely event that the counterparties fail to meet the terms of a foreign currency contract, our exposure is limited to the foreign currency exchange rate differential.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Concentration of Credit Risk</h4><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">We sell our products and services to numerous companies in the oil and natural gas industry. Although this concentration could affect our overall exposure to credit risk, we believe that</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 36pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">we are exposed to minimal risk since the majority of our busi- ness is conducted with major companies within the industry. We perform periodic credit evaluations of our customers’ financial condition and generally do not require collateral for our accounts receivable. In some cases, we will require pay- ment in advance or security in the form of a letter of credit  or bank guarantee.</p><p style="padding-left: 36pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">We maintain cash deposits with major banks that may exceed federally insured limits. We periodically assess the financial condition of the institutions and believe that the risk of any loss is minimal.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s48" style="padding-left: 36pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Note 13. segment and Related information</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 36pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">In 2005, we reorganized our operating divisions into two separate segments: the Drilling and Evaluation segment, which consists of the Baker Atlas, Baker Hughes Drilling Fluids, Hughes Christensen and INTEQ divisions, and the Completion and Pro- duction segment, which consists of the Baker Oil Tools, Baker Petrolite and Centrilift divisions. The Completion and Production segment also includes our Production Optimization business unit. The reorganization was done to align product lines based on the types of products and services provided to our custom- ers, to provide additional focus on our product lines and tech- nology and to be able to more effectively serve our customers.</p><p style="padding-left: 36pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">Accordingly, we are reporting our results under three seg- ments: Drilling and Evaluation, Completion and Production and WesternGeco. Divisions in the Drilling and Evaluation segment generally provide services and products used directly in the</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">drilling and formation evaluation of oil and natural gas wells. Divisions in the Completion and Production segment generally provide services and products used to complete wells, rework existing wells and enhance or initiate production from new wells.</p><p style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">We have aggregated the divisions within each segment because they have similar economic characteristics and because the long-term financial performance of these divisions is affected by similar economic conditions. They also operate in the same markets, which include all of the major oil and natural gas producing regions of the world. The results of each segment are evaluated regularly by our chief operating decision maker in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance. All prior period segment information has been restated to reflect these changes.</p><p style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">The accounting policies of our segments are the same as those described in Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. We evaluate the performance of our segments based on segment profit (loss), which is defined as income from continuing operations before income taxes, accounting changes, restructuring charge reversals, impairment of assets and interest income and expense.</p><p style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">Summarized financial information is shown in the following table. The “Corporate and Other” column includes corporate- related items, results of insignificant operations and, as it relates to segment profit (loss), income and expense not allocated to</p><p style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">the segments, including restructuring charge reversals and impair- ment of assets. The “Corporate and Other” column, for all peri- ods presented, also includes assets of discontinued operations.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><table

reported, generally all of our U.S. employees were eligible to participate in our sponsored Thrift Plan, which is a 401(k) plan under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. The Thrift Plan allows eligible employ- ees to elect to contribute from 1% to 50% of their salaries to an investment trust. Employee contributions are matched in cash by us at the rate of $1.00 per $1.00 employee contribution for the first 3% and $0.50 per $1.00 employee contribution for the next 2% of the employee’s salary. Such</p><p style="padding-left: 36pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">contributions vest immediately. In addition, we make cash con- tributions for all eligible employees between 2% and 5% of their salary depending on the employee’s age. Such contribu- tions become fully vested to the employee after five years of employment. The Thrift Plan provides for ten different invest- ment options, for which the employee has sole discretion in determining how both the employer and employee contribu- tions are invested. Our contributions to the Thrift Plan and several other non-U.S. defined contribution plans amounted</p><p style="padding-left: 36pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">to $86.5 million, $75.5 million and $67.7 million in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.</p><p style="padding-left: 51pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">For certain non-U.S. employees who are not eligible</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 36pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">to participate in the Thrift Plan, we provide a non-qualified defined contribution plan that provides basically the same ben- efits as the Thrift Plan. In addition, we provide a non-qualified supplemental retirement plan (“SRP”) for certain officers and employees whose benefits under the Thrift Plan and/or the</p><p style="padding-left: 36pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">U.S. defined benefit pension plan are limited by federal tax law. The SRP also allows the eligible employees to defer a portion of their eligible compensation and provides for employer matching and base contributions pursuant to limita- tions. Both non-qualified plans are fully funded and invested through trusts, and the assets and corresponding liabilities are included in our consolidated balance sheet. Our contributions to these non-qualified plans were $7.2 million, $6.1 million and $5.5 million for 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 36pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Postemployment Benefits</h4><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 36pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">We provide certain postemployment disability income, medical and other benefits to substantially all qualifying former or inactive U.S. employees. Income benefits for long- term disability are provided through a fully-insured plan. The continuation of medical and other benefits while on disability (“Continuation Benefits”) are provided through a qualified self-insured plan. The accrued postemployment liability for Continuation Benefits at December 31, 2005 and 2004 was</p><p style="padding-left: 36pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">$17.5 million and $20.2 million, respectively, and is included in other liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet.</p><p class="s48" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">Note 16. Commitments and Contingencies <span style=" color: #231F20;">leases</span></p><p style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">At December 31, 2005, we had long-term non-cancelable operating leases covering certain facilities and equipment.</p><p style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">The minimum annual rental commitments, net of amounts due under subleases, for each of the five years in the period ending December 31, 2010 are $74.7 million, $54.6 million,</p><p style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">$39.2 million, $25.0 million and $16.8 million, respectively, and $103.7 million in the aggregate thereafter. We have not entered into any significant capital leases.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">litigation</h4><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">We are involved in litigation or proceedings that have arisen in our ordinary business activities. We insure against these risks to the extent deemed prudent by our management and to the extent insurance is available, but no assurance can be given that the nature and amount of such insurance will be sufficient to fully indemnify us against liabilities arising out of pending and future legal proceedings. Many of these insur- ance policies contain deductibles or self-insured retentions in amounts we deem prudent, and for which we are responsible for payment. In determining the amount of self-insurance, it is our policy to self-insure those losses that are predictable, mea- surable and recurring in nature, such as claims for automobile liability, general liability and workers compensation. We record accruals for the uninsured portion of losses related to these types of claims. The accruals for losses are calculated by esti- mating losses for claims using historical claim data, specific loss development factors and other information as necessary.</p><p style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">On March 29, 2002, we announced that we had been advised that the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) and the Department of Justice (“DOJ”) are conducting investi- gations into allegations of violations of law relating to Nigeria and other related matters. The SEC has issued a formal order of investigation into possible violations of provisions under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”) regarding anti-bribery, books and records and internal controls. The SEC has issued subpoenas seeking information about our operations in Angola (subpoena dated August 6, 2003) and Kazakhstan (subpoenas dated August 6, 2003 and April 22, 2005) as part of its ongoing investigation. We are providing documents to and cooperating fully with the SEC and DOJ. The DOJ and the SEC have issued subpoenas to, or otherwise asked for inter- views with, current and former employees in connection with the investigations regarding Nigeria, Angola and Kazakhstan. In addition, we have conducted internal investigations into these matters.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">Our internal investigations have identified issues regarding the propriety of certain payments and apparent deficiencies in our books and records and internal controls with respect to certain operations in Nigeria, Angola and Kazakhstan, as well as potential liabilities to governmental authorities in Nigeria. The internal investigation in Nigeria was substantially com- pleted during the first quarter of 2003 and, based upon current information, we do not expect that any such potential liabilities will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements. The internal investigations in Angola and Kazakh- stan were substantially completed in the third quarter of 2004. Evidence obtained during the course of the internal investiga- tions has been provided to the SEC and DOJ.</p><p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">The Department of Commerce, Department of the Navy and DOJ (the “U.S. agencies”) have investigated compliance with certain export licenses issued to Western Geophysical from 1994 through 2000 for export of seismic equipment leased by the People’s Republic of China. We acquired Western Geophysical in August 1998 and subsequently transferred related assets to WesternGeco in December 2000. Western- Geco continued to use the licenses until 2001. Under the WesternGeco Formation Agreement, we owe indemnity to WesternGeco for certain matters and, accordingly, we have agreed to indemnify WesternGeco with certain limitations in connection with this matter. We are cooperating fully with</p><p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">the U.S. agencies.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">We have received a subpoena from a grand jury in the Southern District of New York regarding goods and services we delivered to Iraq from 1995 through 2003 during the United Nations Oil-for-Food Program. We have also received a request from the SEC to provide a written statement and</p><p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">certain information regarding our participation in that program.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">We have responded to both the subpoena and the request and may provide additional information and documents in the future. Other companies in the energy industry are believed to have received similar subpoenas and requests.</p><p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">The U.S. agencies, the SEC and other authorities have a broad range of civil and criminal sanctions they may seek to impose against corporations and individuals in appropriate circumstances including, but not limited to, injunctive relief, disgorgement, fines, penalties and modifications to business practices and compliance programs. Such agencies and authorities have entered into agreements with, and obtained a range of sanctions against, several public corporations and individuals arising from allegations of improper payments and deficiencies in books and records and internal controls, whereby civil and criminal penalties were imposed, including in some cases multi-million dollar fines and other sanctions. We are in discussions with the U.S. agencies and the SEC regarding the resolution, including sanctions, associated with certain of the</p><p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">matters described above. It is not possible to accurately predict at this time when any of these matters will be resolved. Based on current information, we cannot predict the outcome of such investigations, whether we will reach resolution through such discussions or what, if any, actions may be taken by the</p><p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">U.S. agencies, the SEC or other authorities or the effect the actions may have on our consolidated financial statements.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">On May 10, 2004, the District Court of Andrews County, Texas entered a judgment in favor of LOTUS, LLC and against INTEQ in the amount of $14.8 million for lost profits resulting from a breach of contract in drilling a well to create a salt cav- ern for disposing of naturally occurring radioactive waste. We have filed an appeal and taken other actions. We believe that any liability that we may incur as a result of this litigation would not have a material adverse financial effect on our consolidated financial statements.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">environmental matters</h4><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">Our past and present operations include activities which are subject to extensive domestic (including U.S. federal, state and local) and international environmental regulations with regard to air and water quality and other environmental mat- ters. Our environmental procedures, policies and practices are designed to ensure compliance with existing laws and regula- tions and to minimize the possibility of significant environmen- tal damage.</p><p style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">We are involved in voluntary remediation projects at some of our present and former manufacturing facilities, the majority of which relate to properties obtained in acquisitions</p><p style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">or to sites no longer actively used in operations. On rare occa- sions, remediation activities are conducted as specified by a government agency-issued consent decree or agreed order.</p><p style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">Remediation costs are accrued based on estimates of probable exposure using currently available facts, existing environmental permits, technology and presently enacted laws and regula- tions. Remediation cost estimates include direct costs related to the environmental investigation, external consulting activi- ties, governmental oversight fees, treatment equipment and costs associated with long-term operation, maintenance and monitoring of a remediation project.</p><p style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">We have also been identified as a potentially responsible party (“PRP”) in remedial activities related to various Super- fund sites. We participate in the process set out in the Joint Participation and Defense Agreement to negotiate with gov- ernment agencies, identify other PRPs and determine each PRP’s allocation and estimate remediation costs. We have accrued what we believe to be our pro-rata share of the total estimated cost of remediation and associated management of these Superfund sites. This share is based upon the ratio that the estimated volume of waste we contributed to the site bears to the total estimated volume of waste disposed at the site. Applicable United States federal law imposes joint and several liability on each PRP for the cleanup of these sites leav- ing us with the uncertainty that we may be responsible for the remediation cost attributable to other PRPs who are unable to pay their share. No accrual has been made under the joint and several liability concept for those Superfund sites where our participation is <i>de minimis </i>since we believe that the probability that we will have to pay material costs above our volumetric share is remote. We believe there are other PRPs who have greater involvement on a volumetric calculation basis, who have substantial assets and who may be reasonably expected to pay their share of the cost of remediation. For those Super- fund sites where we are a significant PRP, remediation costs</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 36pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">are estimated to include recalcitrant parties. In some cases, we have insurance coverage or contractual indemnities from third parties to cover a portion of or the ultimate liability.</p><p style="padding-left: 51pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">Our total accrual for environmental remediation is</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 35pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">$17.4 million and $13.6 million, which includes accruals of</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 36pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">$4.9 million and $3.6 million for the various Superfund sites, at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The determi- nation of the required accruals for remediation costs is subject to uncertainty, including the evolving nature of environmental regulations and the difficulty in estimating the extent and type of remediation activity that will be utilized. We believe that the likelihood of material losses in excess of the recorded accruals is remote.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 36pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">other</h4><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 35pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">In the normal course of business with customers, ven- dors and others, we have entered into off-balance sheet arrangements, such as letters of credit and other bank issued guarantees, which totaled approximately $319.8 million at December 31, 2005. We also had commitments outstanding for purchase obligations related to capital expenditures and inventory under purchase orders and contracts of approxi- mately $173.0 million at December 31, 2005. In addition,</p><p style="padding-left: 36pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">at December 31, 2005, we have guaranteed debt and other obligations of third parties with a maximum exposure of</p><p style="padding-left: 36pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">$1.4 million. It is not practicable to estimate the fair value</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 36pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">of these financial instruments.

SFAS No. 143 requires that the fair value of a liability associated with an asset retire- ment obligation (“ARO”) be recognized in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate can be made. The liability for the ARO is revised each subsequent period due to the pas- sage of time and changes in estimates. The associated retire- ment costs are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the long-lived asset and subsequently depreciated over the esti- mated useful life of the asset. The adoption of SFAS No. 143 in 2003 resulted in a charge of $5.6 million, net of tax of</p><p style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">$2.8 million, recorded as the cumulative effect of accounting change in the consolidated statement of operations. In con- junction with the adoption, we recorded ARO liabilities of</p><p style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">$11.4 million primarily for anticipated costs of obligations associated with the future disposal of power source units at certain of our divisions and refurbishment costs associated with certain leased facilities in Europe and with a fleet of leased railcars and tanks.</p><p style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">On December 31, 2005, we adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Interpretation No. 47 (“FIN 47”), <i>Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations</i>. FIN 47 clarifies that the term “conditional asset retirement obligation” as used in SFAS No. 143, <i>Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations</i>, refers to a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity in which the timing and/or method of settlement are conditional on a future event that may or may not be within the control of the entity. The obligation to perform the asset retirement activity is unconditional even though uncertainty exists about the timing and/or method of settlement. FIN 47 also clarifies when an entity would have sufficient information to reasonably estimate the fair value of an asset retirement obligation. The adoption of FIN 47 resulted in a charge of</p><p style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">$0.9 million, net of tax of $0.5 million, recorded as the cumu- lative effect of accounting change in the consolidated state- ment of operations. In conjunction with the adoption, we recorded conditional asset retirement obligations of $1.6 mil- lion as the fair value of the costs associated with the special handling of asbestos related materials in certain facilities.</p><p style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">We also have certain facilities that contain asbestos related materials for which a liability has not been recognized because the fair value cannot be reasonably estimated. We believe that there are indeterminate settlement dates for these obligations because the range of time over which we would settle these obligations is unknown or cannot be estimated; therefore, sufficient information does not exist to apply an expected present value technique.</p><p style="padding-left: 36pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="321"

The 2002 Employee LTIP permits the grant of awards as nonqualified stock options, stock apprecia- tion rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units, performance shares, performance units, stock awards and cash-based awards to our corporate officers and key employees. The num- ber of shares authorized for issuance under the 2002 Employee LTIP is 9.5 million, with no more than 3.0 million available for grant as awards other than options (the number of shares is subject to adjustment for changes in our common stock).</p><p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">The 2002 Employee LTIP is the companion plan to the Baker Hughes Incorporated 2002 Director &amp; Officer Long- Term Incentive Plan, which was approved by our stockholders in 2002. The rationale for the two companion plans was to discontinue the use of the remaining older option plans and to have only two plans from which we would issue compen- sation awards.</p><p class="s50" style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">Options<span class="p">.

Under the terms and conditions of the stock option awards for options issued under the 2002 Employee LTIP, options generally vest and become exercisable in installments over the optionee’s period of service, and the options vest on an accelerated basis in the event of a change in control or certain terminations of employment. As of December 31, 2005, options covering approximately 2.8 million shares of our common stock were outstanding under the 2002 Employee LTIP, options covering approximately 1.0 million shares were exercised during fiscal year 2005 and approximately 4.8 million shares remained available for future options.</p><p class="s50" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">Performance Shares and Units; Cash-Based Awards<span class="p">. Perfor- mance shares may be granted to employees in the amounts and upon the terms determined by the Compensation Com- mittee of our Board of Directors, but must be limited to no more than 1.0 million shares to any one employee in any one fiscal year. Performance shares will have an initial value equal to the fair market value of our common stock at the date of the award. Performance units and cash-based awards may be granted to employees in amounts and upon the terms deter- mined by the Compensation Committee, but must be limited to no more than $10.0 million for any one employee in any one fiscal year. The performance measures that may be used to determine the extent of the actual performance payout or vesting include, but are not limited to, net earnings; earnings per share; return measures; cash flow return on investments (net cash flows divided by owner’s equity); earnings before or after taxes, interest, depreciation and/or amortization; share price (including growth measures and total shareholder return) and Baker Value Added (our metric that measures operating profit after tax less the cost of capital employed).</span></p><p class="s50" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">Restricted Stock and Restricted Stock Units<span class="p">. With respect to awards of restricted stock and restricted stock units, the Compensation Committee will determine the conditions or restrictions on the awards, including whether the holders of the restricted stock or restricted stock units will exercise full voting rights or receive dividends and other distributions dur- ing the restriction period. At the time the award is made, the Compensation Committee will determine the right to receive unvested restricted stock or restricted units after termination of service. Awards of restricted stock are limited to 1.0 million shares in any one year to any one individual.</span></p><p class="s50" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">Stock Appreciation Rights<span class="p">. Stock appreciation rights may be granted under the 2002 Employee LTIP on the terms and condi- tions determined by the Compensation Committee. The grant price of a freestanding stock appreciation right will not be less than the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant. The maximum number of shares of our common stock that may be utilized for purposes of determining an employee’s compensation under stock appreciation rights granted under the 2002 Employee LTIP during any one fiscal year will not exceed 3.0 million shares, subject to adjustment under the antidilution provisions of the 2002 Employee LTIP.</span></p><p class="s50" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 36pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">Administration; Amendment and Termination<span class="p">.

The Compensation Committee will have full and exclusive power to interpret the provisions of the 2002 Employee LTIP as the Committee may deem neces- sary or proper, with the powers exercised in the best interests of the Company and in keeping with the objectives of the Plan. The Board may alter, amend, modify, suspend or termi- nate the 2002 Employee LTIP, except that no amendment, modification, suspension or termination that would adversely affect in any material way the rights of a participant under any award previously granted under the Plan may be made without the written consent of the participant or to the</span></p><p style="padding-left: 36pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">extent stockholder approval is otherwise required by applicable legal requirements.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s50" style="padding-left: 36pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Director Compensation Deferral Plan</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 36pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">The Baker Hughes Incorporated Director Compensation Deferral Plan, as amended and restated effective July 24, 2002 (the “Deferral Plan”), is intended to provide a means for mem- bers of our Board of Directors to defer compensation other- wise payable and provide flexibility with respect to our compensation policies. Under the provisions of the Deferral Plan, directors may elect to defer income with respect to</p><p style="padding-left: 36pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">each calendar year. The compensation deferrals may be stock option-related deferrals or cash-based deferrals. The stock option-related deferrals may be either market-priced stock options or discounted stock options. The number of shares to be issued for the market-priced stock option deferral is calcu- lated on a quarterly basis by multiplying the deferred compen- sation by 4.4 and then dividing by the fair market value of our</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">common stock on the last day of the quarter. The number of shares to be issued for the discounted stock option deferral is calculated on a quarterly basis by dividing the deferred com- pensation by the discounted price of our common stock on the last day of the quarter. The discounted price is 50% of the fair market value of our common stock on the valuation date. Stock options granted under the Deferral Plan vest on the first anniversary of the date of grant and must be exercised within 10 years of the date of grant. If a director’s directorship ter- minates for any reason, any options outstanding will expire</p><ol id="l94"><li style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">years after the termination of the directorship.

The board may waive these requirements if it believes retention of the board member is in the best interest of our company. In addi- tion, any nominee for director who receives a “withhold” vote representing a majority of the votes cast for his or her election is required to submit a letter of resignation to the Board’s Gov- ernance Committee.
