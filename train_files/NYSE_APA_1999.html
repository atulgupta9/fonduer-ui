Quantities of natural gas are expressed in this report in terms of thousand cubic feet (Mcf), million cubic feet (MMcf) or billion cubic feet (Bcf). Oil is quantified in terms of barrels (bbls); thousands of barrels (Mbbls) and millions of barrels (MMbbls). Natural gas is compared to oil in terms of barrels of oil equivalent (boe) or million barrels of oil equivalent (MMboe). Oil and natural gas liquids are compared with natural gas in terms of million cubic feet equivalent (MMcfe) and billion cubic feet equivalent (Bcfe). One barrel of oil is the energy equivalent of six Mcf of natural gas. Daily oil and gas production is expressed in terms of barrels of oil per day (b/d) and thousands of cubic feet of gas per day (Mcf/d) or millions of British thermal units per day (MMBtu/d), respectively. Gas sales volumes may be expressed in terms of one million British thermal units (MMBtu), which is approximately, equal to one Mcf. With respect to information relating to the Company&#39;s working interest in wells or acreage, &quot;net&quot; oil and gas wells or acreage is determined by multiplying gross wells or acreage by the Company&#39;s working interest therein. Unless otherwise specified, all references to wells and acres are gross.</p><h2 style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">PART I</h2><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h2 style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 220%;text-align: left;">ITEM 1. BUSINESS GENERAL</h2><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Apache Corporation (Apache or the Company), a Delaware corporation formed in 1954, is an independent energy company that explores for, develops and produces natural gas, crude oil and natural gas liquids. In North America, Apache&#39;s exploration and production interests are focused on the Gulf of Mexico, the Anadarko Basin, the Permian Basin, the Gulf Coast and the Western Sedimentary Basin of Canada. Outside of North America, Apache has exploration and production interests offshore Western Australia, in Egypt and offshore the Ivory Coast, and exploration interests in Poland and offshore The People&#39;s Republic of China (China). Apache common stock, par value $1.25 per share, has been listed on the New York Stock Exchange since 1969, and on the Chicago Stock Exchange since 1960.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Apache holds interests in many of its U.S., Canadian and international properties through operating subsidiaries, such as Apache Canada Ltd., DEK Energy Company (DEKALB, formerly known as DEKALB Energy Company), Apache Energy Limited (formerly known as Hadson Energy Limited), Apache International, Inc., and Apache Overseas, Inc. Properties referred to in this document may be held by those subsidiaries. Apache treats all operations as one line of business.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h2 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">1998 RESULTS</h2><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In 1998, Apache had a loss attributable to common stock of $131.4 million, or $1.34 per share, on total revenues of $875.7 million. The loss reflected, in large part, the effects of a $158 million after-tax, non-cash charge resulting from a $243 million price-related reduction in Apache&#39;s proved oil and gas reserves in the United States. Net cash provided by operating activities during 1998 was $471.5 million.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Apache had its 21st consecutive year of production growth and 11th consecutive year of oil and gas reserves growth in 1998. Apache&#39;s average daily production was 75.8 Mbbls of oil and natural gas liquids and 590 MMcf of natural gas for the year. Giving effect to 1998 production, acquisitions, dispositions, revisions and drilling activity, the Company&#39;s estimated proved reserves increased by 27.3 MMboe in 1998 over the prior year to 613 MMboe, of which approximately 59 percent was natural gas. Based on 585.7 MMboe reported at year-end 1997, Apache&#39;s reserve growth from drilling activity during the year reflects replacement of 236 percent of the Company&#39;s 1998 production. Apache&#39;s active drilling and production-enhancement program yielded 276 new producing wells out of 383 attempts and involved 590 major North American workover and recompletion projects during the year.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">At December 31, 1998, Apache held interests in approximately 4,086 net oil and gas wells and 1,803,932 net developed acres of oil and gas properties worldwide. In addition, the Company had approximately 593,204 net undeveloped acres under North American leases and 22,566,883 net undeveloped acres under international exploration and production rights.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h2 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">APACHE&#39;S GROWTH STRATEGY</h2><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Apache&#39;s growth strategy is to increase oil and gas reserves, production, cash flow and earnings through a combination of exploratory drilling, development of its inventory of existing projects and property acquisitions meeting defined financial parameters. The Company&#39;s drilling program emphasizes reserve additions through moderate-risk drilling primarily on its North American interests, and exploratory drilling primarily on its international interests. The Company also emphasizes reducing operating costs per unit produced and selling marginal and non- strategic properties in order to enhance its profit margins.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Apache&#39;s international investments and exploration activities are an emerging component of its long-term growth strategy. In addition to an active, moderate-risk drilling program in Apache&#39;s North American focus areas, higher-risk international exploration offers potential for greater rewards and significant reserve additions. Apache directed its international efforts in 1998 toward development of certain discoveries offshore Western Australia, offshore the Ivory Coast, in Egypt and offshore China, and toward further exploration</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">1</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">efforts in those areas and on its concessions in Poland. Apache believes that reserve additions in these international areas are likely to continue through higher-risk exploration and through improved production practices and recovery techniques.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">For Apache, property acquisition is only one phase in a continuing cycle of business growth. Apache&#39;s aim is to follow each acquisition with a cycle of reserve enhancement, property consolidation and cash flow acceleration, facilitating asset growth and debt reduction. This approach requires a well planned and carefully executed property development program and, where appropriate, a selective program of property dispositions. It motivates Apache to target acquisitions that have ascertainable additional reserve potential and to apply an active drilling, workover and recompletion program to realize the potential of the acquired undeveloped and partially developed properties. Apache prefers to operate its properties so that it can best influence their development; as a result, the Company operates properties accounting for over 80 percent of its production.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h2 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">1998 ACQUISITIONS AND DISPOSITIONS</h2><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">On November 13, 1998, the Company entered into agreements to acquire certain oil and gas interests and companies holding oil and gas interests in the Carnarvon Basin, offshore Western Australia, from subsidiaries of Novus Petroleum Limited (Novus) for approximately $55 million. The interests have estimated proved reserves of approximately 5.8 MMboe and daily production of 2,400 barrels of oil equivalent. They are within the Apache-operated Harriet Joint Venture (which includes production, processing and pipeline infrastructure associated with the Varanus Island hub), the Airlie Joint Venture (in which the Company held a prior interest and became operator) and three other exploration permit areas. The transaction closed in two stages, on December 18, 1998 (approximately $49 million), and on January 29, 1999 (approximately $6 million). Under the terms of an agreement with Novus, the Company may be required to make additional payments to Novus based on proved and probable recoverable oil and condensate reserves, as determined by independent engineers, on a defined geological structure in the Gipsy-Rose-Lee area, offshore Western Australia. If required, such payments would be calculated using $2.50 for each barrel of proved and $1.25 for each barrel of probable oil and condensate reserves. A payment becomes due if and when a decision is made to construct facilities for the production of oil or condensate from the designated area.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">On February 1, 1999, the Company acquired oil and gas properties located in the Gulf of Mexico from Petsec Energy Inc. (Petsec) for an adjusted purchase price of approximately $66.7 million. The Petsec transaction included estimated proved reserves of approximately 10.4 MMboe on the effective date.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In several transactions with various buyers, Apache also sold largely marginal properties containing 29.6 MMboe of proved reserves for $131.1 million. Following the Ampolex Group Transaction described in Apache&#39;s 1997 Annual Report on Form 10-K, the Company entered into an agreement with Hardy Petroleum Limited (Hardy) pursuant to which Hardy agreed to purchase a 10 percent interest in the company&#39;s East Spar field and related production facilities. This transaction closed in January 1998 with a total sales price of approximately $63 million in cash. The Ampolex Group Transaction was recorded net of these interests.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In June 1998, Apache formed a strategic alliance with Cinergy Corp. (Cinergy) to market substantially all the Company&#39;s natural gas production from North America and sold its 57 percent interest in Producers Energy Marketing LLC (ProEnergy) for 771,258 shares of Cinergy common stock, subsequently sold for $26.1 million. ProEnergy will continue to market Apache&#39;s North American natural gas production for 10 years, with an option to terminate after six years, under an amended and restated gas purchase agreement effective July 1, 1998. During this period, Apache is generally obligated to deliver most of its North American gas production to Cinergy and, under certain circumstances, reimburse Cinergy if certain gas throughput thresholds are not met. Accordingly, Apache recorded a deferred gain of $20 million, subject to adjustment, on the sale of ProEnergy that is being amortized over six years.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h2 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION</h2><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Company&#39;s North American exploration and production activities are diversified among four operating regions: Gulf, Midcontinent, Western and Canada. Approximately 62 percent of the Company&#39;s</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">2</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">proved reserves are located in these North American regions. Egypt and Australia are the Company&#39;s most important international regions. The Company&#39;s Egyptian operations are headquartered in Cairo, and Apache conducts its Australian exploration and production operations from Perth. Information concerning the amount of revenue, operating income (loss) and total assets attributable to U.S., Canadian and international operations is set forth in Note 12 to the Company&#39;s consolidated financial statements under Item 8 below.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Gulf. The Gulf region encompasses the Texas and Louisiana coasts, central Texas and the Company&#39;s interests in the Gulf of Mexico, offshore Louisiana and Texas. In 1998, the Gulf region was Apache&#39;s leading region for production and production revenues contributing approximately</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">$224 million in revenues from production of 17.9 MMboe for the year. The Company performed 182 workover and recompletion operations during 1998 in the Gulf region and participated in drilling 30 wells, 11 of which were completed as producers. As of December 31, 1998, the region encompassed 482,546 net acres, and accounted for 81.3 MMboe, or 13 percent, of the Company&#39;s year-end 1998 total estimated proved reserves.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Midcontinent. Apache&#39;s Midcontinent region operates in Oklahoma, eastern and northern Texas, Arkansas and northern Louisiana. The region has focused operations on its sizable position in the Anadarko Basin of western Oklahoma. Apache has drilled and operated in the Anadarko Basin for over four decades, developing an extensive database of geologic information and a substantial acreage position. In 1998, the Midcontinent region had approximately 11.8 MMboe of production generating $144 million in revenue for the Company.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">At December 31, 1998, Apache held an interest in 413,690 net acres in the region, which accounted for approximately 101.8 MMboe, or 17 percent, of Apache&#39;s total estimated proved reserves. Apache participated in drilling 105 wells in the Midcontinent region during the year, 86 of which were completed as producing wells. The Company performed 45 workover and recompletion operations in the region during 1998.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Western. The Western region includes assets in the Permian Basin of western Texas and New Mexico and the San Juan Basin of New Mexico. In 1998, the Western region produced approximately 9.9 MMboe and generated $114 million in production revenue. At December 31, 1998, the Company held 422,914 net acres in the region, which accounted for 127.8 MMboe or 21 percent, of the Company&#39;s total estimated proved reserves. Apache participated in drilling 98 wells in the Western region, 86 of which were productive wells. Apache performed 294 workovers and recompletions in the Western region during the year.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Canada. Exploration and development activity in the Canadian region is concentrated in the Provinces of Alberta and British Columbia. The region produced approximately 7.4 MMboe and generated $64 million in production revenue in 1998. Apache participated in drilling 66 wells in this region during the year, 47 of which were completed as producers. The Company performed 69 workovers and recompletions on operated wells during 1998. At December 31, 1998, the region encompassed approximately 372,720 net acres, and accounted for 67.3 MMboe, or 11 percent, of the Company&#39;s year-end 1998 total estimated proved reserves.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Egypt. At year end, Apache held 13,279,201 net acres in Egypt with 87.6 MMboe of estimated proved reserves or 14 percent of Apache&#39;s total estimated proved reserves. In 1998, Apache had 10.3 MMboe of production in Egypt, which generated $129 million in production revenues. Apache owns a 75 percent interest in the Qarun Block and a 40 percent interest in the Khalda Block, both in the Western Desert of Egypt.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Future production of gas from Khalda is expected to be delivered for sale to the Egyptian General Petroleum Corporation (EGPC) at a point west of Alexandria, Egypt, via a 34-inch gas pipeline, construction of which commenced in 1997 with completion of the pipeline projected to occur in 1999. The costs of building the pipeline will be borne by Apache, the other Khalda participants, and the owners of a neighboring block. Construction costs paid by Apache and the other Khalda participants are recoverable from oil and gas production from the Khalda Block.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Both the Khalda and Qarun Concession Agreements provide that Apache and its partners in the concessions will pay all of the operating and capital costs for developing the concessions, while the production will be split between EGPC and the partners. Up to 40 percent of the oil and gas produced from each of the concessions is available to the Company and its partners to recover operating and capital costs for the applicable concession. To the extent eligible costs exceed 40 percent of the oil and gas produced and sold from</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">3</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">a concession in any given quarter, such excess costs may be carried into future quarters without limit. The remaining 60 percent of all oil and gas produced from the concessions is divided between EGPC and Apache and its partners, with the percentage received by Apache and its partners reducing as the gross daily average of oil and gas produced on a quarterly basis increases. Under the Khalda Agreement, capital costs are amortized over four years, while the Qarun agreement provides for a five-year amortization.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In addition to the Qarun and Khalda Blocks, Apache holds interests in the East Beni Suef and Asyout Blocks to the south of the Qarun Block, and three other blocks in the Western Desert of Egypt, the North East Abu Gharadig Block, the East Bahariya Block, and the West Mediterranean Block No. 1 (partly onshore and partly offshore). Apache also acquired interests in the Ras El Hekma and Ras Kanayes concessions from Repsol Exploracion Egipto S.A. in December 1997, and during 1998, Apache became the operator of the W. Mediterranean and East Beni Suef Blocks. Exploratory drilling on the East Beni Suef Block commenced in 1997 with a significant discovery made on the #1 well. Delineation drilling continued in 1998. Due to conflicting governmental requirements regarding the placement of drilling rigs on the Darag Block, the Company relinquished the Darag concession in the Gulf of Suez and received a refund of a portion of its expenses related to the concession.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Australia. Western Australia became an important region for Apache after the 1993 acquisition of Hadson Energy Resources Corporation (subsequently known as Apache Energy Resources Corporation). In 1998, natural gas production in the region increased by 95 percent from the prior year to approximately 51 MMcf/d. Apache acts as operator for most of its Western Australia properties through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Apache Energy Limited (AEL). During 1998, Apache had</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">6.3 MMboe of production generating $70 million of production revenue. Estimated proved reserves in Australia increased by 66 percent to</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">132.7 MMboe, or 22 percent of the Company&#39;s year-end total estimated proved reserves. The increase reflects, among other matters, the acquisition from Novus of three companies with holdings in the East Spar and Harriet fields. As of December 31, 1998, Apache held 226,720 net developed acres and 1,421,290 net undeveloped acres offshore Western Australia. Through AEL and its subsidiaries, Apache also operates the Harriet Gas Gathering Project, a gas processing and compression facility with a throughput capacity of 175 MMcf/d, and a 60-mile, 12-inch offshore pipeline with a throughput capacity of 175 MMcf/d that connects to a pipeline grid onshore. The Company and the other participants in the East Spar and Harriet joint ventures are currently building a second 60 mile, 16-inch, natural gas pipeline from Varanus Island to a connection with the existing Dampier to Banbury gas pipelines, which is expected to be completed in March 1999. See &quot;1998 Acquisitions and Dispositions&quot; and &quot;Oil and Natural Gas Marketing.&quot;</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Other International Operations. Outside of Canada, Egypt and Australia, Apache currently has exploration and production interests offshore the Ivory Coast, and exploration interests in Poland and offshore China.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Apache obtained its first properties in Poland on April 16, 1997 when the Company assumed operatorship and a 50 percent interest in over 5.5 million acres in Poland located near Lublin, southeast of Warsaw, from FX Energy, Inc. (FX Energy). The Company has since acquired additional acreage in Poland, including approximately 1.8 million acres in the Carpathian area near the southern border of Poland and participation in a further 2.275 million acres in the Pomeranian area of northwest Poland, giving Apache interests in 12,038,676 total gross undeveloped acres and 7,494,122 net undeveloped acres as of December 31, 1998. The concessions in Poland include requirements for Apache to drill at least eleven wells and to shoot at least 1,290 miles of seismic data. At year end, two wells were being drilled in Poland, but were abandoned in the first quarter of 1999. Subsequent to year end, Apache and FX Energy entered into an Area of Mutual Interest Agreement, which covers virtually all of Poland, and plan to enter into further exploration and production agreements with the Polish Oil and Gas Company (POGC), the national oil company of Poland. Apache&#39;s operations in Poland are headquartered in Warsaw.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Apache is also the operator, with a 50 percent interest, of the Zhao Dong Block in Bohai Bay, offshore China. In 1994 and 1995, discovery wells tested at rates between 1,300 and 4,000 b/d of oil. The Company elected to proceed with the second exploration phase, commencing in May 1996, which involved a commitment to drill two additional exploratory wells. In early 1997, one well tested at rates up to 11,571 b/d</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">4</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">of oil and another tested at rates up to 15,359 b/d. An overall development plan for the C and D Fields in the Zhao Dong Block was submitted to Chinese authorities in late 1997 and is awaiting approval.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In the Ivory Coast, Apache, as operator of the block and holding a 24 percent interest, completed in January 1999 the development of the &quot;Foxtrot&quot; offshore gas field and installed a platform and pipeline to shore. In March 1997, Apache and its partners signed a 10 year take or pay contract to supply approximately 168 Bcf of gas to a power plant in Abidjan at 30 MMcf/d initially, rising to 50 MMcf/d in the third year. Gas deliveries are expected to commence in the second quarter of 1999.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h2 style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">OIL AND NATURAL GAS MARKETING</h2><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">On October 27, 1995, wholly owned affiliates of each of Apache, Oryx Energy Company and Parker &amp; Parsley Petroleum Company (Parker &amp; Parsley) formed ProEnergy, a Delaware limited liability company. ProEnergy became fully operational on April 1, 1996, and marketed substantially all of its members&#39; domestic natural gas pursuant to member gas purchase agreements having an initial term of 10 years, subject to early termination following specified events. The price of gas purchased by ProEnergy from its members was based upon agreed to published indexes. Effective January 1, 1998, Parker &amp; Parsley withdrew from ProEnergy. As more fully described in &quot;1998 Acquisitions and Dispositions&quot; above, in June 1998, Apache sold its interest in ProEnergy to Cinergy and formed a strategic alliance with Cinergy to market substantially all the Company&#39;s natural gas production from North America. ProEnergy will continue to market Apache&#39;s North American natural gas production for 10 years, with an option to terminate after six years, under an amended and restated gas purchase agreement effective July 1, 1998. During this period, Apache is generally obligated to deliver most of its North American gas production to Cinergy and, under certain circumstances, may have to make payments to Cinergy if certain gas throughput thresholds are not met.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Separate from its arrangements with Cinergy, Apache is also delivering natural gas under several long-term supply agreements with terms greater than one year. In 1998, Apache delivered an average of 35 MMcf/d under such contracts at an average price of $2.63 per Mcf.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Apache assumed its own U.S. crude oil marketing operations in 1992. Most of Apache&#39;s U.S. crude oil production is sold through lease-level marketing to refiners, traders and transporters, generally under 30 day contracts that renew automatically until canceled. Oil produced from Canadian properties is sold to crude oil purchasers or refiners at market prices, which depend on worldwide crude prices adjusted for transportation and crude quality. Natural gas produced from Canadian properties is sold to major aggregators of natural gas, gas marketers and direct users under long-term and short-term contracts. The oil and gas contracts provide for sales at specified prices, or at prices that are subject to change due to market conditions.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Company diversifies the markets for its Canadian gas production not presently committed to Cinergy by selling directly or indirectly to customers through aggregators and brokers in the United States and Canada. Apache transports natural gas via the Company&#39;s firm transportation contracts to California (12 MMcf/d) and to the Province of Ontario, Canada (four MMcf/d) through end-users&#39; firm transportation contracts. Pursuant to an agreement entered into in 1994, the Company is also selling five MMcf/d of natural gas to the Hermiston Cogeneration Project, located in the Pacific Northwest of the United States. In 1996, the Company entered into an agreement with Westcoast Gas Services, Inc. for the sale of 5,000 MMBtu/d for delivery in the United States for a 10 year term.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In Australia, the Company entered into several gas sales contracts during 1998, bringing its total to 16 contracts, with terms of four to 12 years, to deliver 311 Bcf of AEL&#39;s gas from its Harriet and East Spar fields for mining, power generation, nickel refining, ammonia production and other industrial and domestic uses. Under these contacts AEL is required to deliver its gas at contract rates of approximately 60 MMcf/day increasing to 92 MMcf/day by the year 2000, with take or pay provisions, net to AEL, of approximately 20 Bcf/year increasing to 23 Bcf/year by the year 2000. Apache operates both the Harriet and the East Spar Joint Ventures, holding a 60 percent interest in Harriet and a 45 percent interest in East Spar.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">AEL marketed all oil and natural gas liquids produced from its interests in the Harriet and East Spar fields during 1998 through a contract with Mitsui Oil (Asia) Pty. Ltd. Pricing under the contract in 1998</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">5</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">represented a fixed premium to the quoted market prices of Tapis crude oil, with payment made in U.S. dollars. In 1998, the weighted average realized price based on regional production was $13.07 per barrel. In January 1999, the Mitsui contract terminated and was replaced by a similar contract with Marubeni International Petroleum Company.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In Egypt, oil from the Qarun Block is delivered by pipeline to tanks owned by the Company and its partners in the Qarun Concession at the Dashour pumping station northeast of the Qarun Block or by truck to the Tebbin refinery south of Alexandria, Egypt. At the discretion of the operator of the pipelines, oil from the Qarun Block is put into the two 42-inch diameter SUMED pipelines, which transport significant quantities of Egyptian and other crude oil from the Gulf of Suez to Sidi Kherir, west of Alexandria, Egypt, on the Mediterranean Coast. All Qarun and Khalda crude oil is currently sold to EGPC. In 1996, the Company and its partners in the Khalda Block entered into a take or pay contract with EGPC, which obligates EGPC to pay for 75 percent of 200 MMcf/d of future production of gas from the Khalda Block. Sales of gas under the contract are expected to begin in May 1999 upon completion of a gas pipeline from the Khalda Block. In late 1997, the same sellers entered into a supplement to the contract with EGPC to sell an additional 50 MMcf/d through a southern gas line being constructed by the Company and its partners from the Khalda Block to a point near the Qarun Block to tie into an existing gas pipeline.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h2 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">OIL AND NATURAL GAS PRICES</h2><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Natural gas prices remained volatile during 1998, with Apache&#39;s realized prices ranging from $2.08 per Mcf in July to $1.73 per Mcf in September. Fluctuations are largely due to market perceptions about natural gas supply and demand. Apache&#39;s average realized gas price of</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">$1.92 per Mcf for 1998 was down 16 percent from the prior-year average of $2.28 per Mcf, and its 1997 average realized natural gas price was 13 percent higher than the 1996 average price of $2.02 per Mcf.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">As a result of minimum price contracts which escalate at an average of 80 percent of the Australian consumer price index, AEL&#39;s natural gas production in Western Australia is not subject to the same degree of price volatility as Apache&#39;s U.S. and Canadian gas production; however, natural gas sales under such Australian minimum price contracts represent less than two percent of the Company&#39;s total natural gas sales at the end of 1998. Total Australian gas sales in 1998, including long-term contracts and spot sales averaged $1.51 per Mcf, down 15 percent from the 1997 average of $1.78 per Mcf due to devaluation of the Australian dollar.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In Egypt, all oil production from the Khalda and Qarun Blocks is currently sold to EGPC on a spot basis at a &quot;Western Desert&quot; price, which is applied to virtually all production from the area and is announced periodically by EGPC. In 1998, the average price was $12.57 per barrel.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Discussions with EGPC regarding the possibility of exporting Qarun oil production are continuing. Once gas sales from the Khalda Block commence, the gas is expected to be sold for a price which, on a Btu basis, is equivalent to 85 percent of the price of Suez Blend crude oil, FOB Mediterranean.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Oil prices remained subject to unpredictable political and economic forces during 1998 and experienced fluctuations similar to those seen in natural gas prices for the year, but showing a general downward trend. Apache believes that oil prices will continue to fluctuate in response to changes in the policies of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), demand from Asian countries, events in the Middle East and other factors associated with the world political and economic environment. As a result of the many uncertainties associated with levels of production maintained by OPEC and other oil producing countries, the availabilities of worldwide energy supplies and the competitive relationships and consumer perceptions of various energy sources, the Company is unable to predict what changes will occur in crude oil and natural gas prices.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In 1998, Apache&#39;s realized worldwide crude oil price ranged from $15.11 per barrel in January to $9.42 per barrel in December. The average crude oil price of $12.66 per barrel in 1998 was down 34 percent from the average price of $19.20 per barrel in 1997, and 39 percent lower than the average price of $20.84 per barrel in 1996. The Company&#39;s average crude oil price for its Australian production was $13.07 per barrel in 1998, 36 percent less than the average price in 1997.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">6</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">From time to time, Apache buys or sells contracts to hedge a limited portion of its future oil and gas production against exposure to spot market price changes. See Note 9 to the Company&#39;s consolidated financial statements under Item 8 below.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Company&#39;s business has been and will continue to be affected by future worldwide changes in oil and gas prices and the relationship between the prices of oil and gas. No assurance can be given as to the trend in, or level of, future oil and gas prices.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h2 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">FULL COST CEILING TEST</h2><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Under the full cost accounting rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the Company reviews the carrying value of its proved oil and gas properties each quarter on a country-by-country basis. Under these rules, capitalized costs of proved oil and gas properties, net of accumulated depreciation, depletion and amortization and deferred income taxes, may not exceed the present value of estimated future net cash flows from proved oil and gas reserves, discounted at 10 percent, plus the lower of cost or fair value of unproved properties included in the costs being amortized, net of related tax effects. These rules generally require pricing future oil and gas production at the unescalated oil and gas prices in effect at the end of each fiscal quarter and require a write-down if the &quot;ceiling&quot; is exceeded, even if prices declined for only a short period of time. The Company recorded a $243.2 million pre-tax ($158.1 million net of tax) non-cash write-down of the carrying value of the Company&#39;s U.S. proved oil and gas properties as of December 31, 1998, due to these ceiling test limitations. If oil and gas prices deteriorate from the Company&#39;s year-end realized prices, it is likely that additional write-downs will occur in 1999. Write-downs required by these rules do not impact cash flow from operating activities.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h2 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">EFFECT OF VOLATILE PRICES</h2><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Company continually analyzes forecasts and updates its estimates of energy prices for its internal use in planning, budgeting, and estimating and valuing reserves. The Company&#39;s future financial condition and results of operations will depend upon the prices received for the Company&#39;s oil and natural gas production and the costs of acquiring, finding, developing and producing reserves. Prices for oil and natural gas are subject to fluctuations in response to relatively minor changes in supply, market uncertainty and a variety of additional factors that are beyond the control of the Company. These factors include worldwide political instability (especially in the Middle East and other oil-producing regions), the foreign supply of oil and gas, the price of foreign imports, the level of drilling activity, the level of consumer product demand, government regulations and taxes, the price and availability of alternative fuels and the overall economic environment. A substantial or extended decline in oil and gas prices would have a material adverse effect on the Company&#39;s financial position, results of operations, quantities of oil and gas that may be economically produced and access to capital. In addition, the sale of the Company&#39;s oil and gas production depends on a number of factors beyond the Company&#39;s control, including the availability and capacity of transportation and processing facilities. Oil and natural gas prices have historically been and are likely to continue to be volatile. Such volatility makes it difficult to estimate with precision the value of producing properties in acquisitions and to budget and project the return on exploration and development projects involving the Company&#39;s oil and gas properties. In addition, unusually volatile prices often disrupt the market for oil and gas properties, as buyers and sellers have more difficulty agreeing on the purchase price of properties.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h2 style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">RESERVES; RATES OF PRODUCTION; DEVELOPMENT EXPENDITURES; CASH FLOW</h2><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of oil and natural gas reserves of any category and in projecting future rates of production and timing of development expenditures, which underlie such reserve estimates, including many factors beyond the control of the Company. Reserve data represents only estimates. In addition, the estimates of future net cash flows from proved reserves of the Company and the present value thereof are based upon various assumptions about future production levels, prices and costs that may prove to be incorrect over time (see below). Any significant variance from the assumptions could result in the actual quantity of the Company&#39;s reserves and future net cash flows therefrom being materially different from the estimates. In addition, the Company&#39;s estimated reserves may be subject to downward or</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">7</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">upward revision based upon production history, results of future exploration and development, prevailing oil and gas prices, operating and development costs, and other factors. The rate of production from oil and gas properties declines as reserves are depleted. Except to the extent that the Company acquires additional properties containing proved reserves, conducts successful exploration and development activities or, through engineering studies, identifies additional behind-pipe zones or secondary recovery reserves, the proved reserves of the Company will decline materially as reserves are produced. Future oil and gas production is, therefore, highly dependent upon the Company&#39;s level of success in acquiring or finding additional reserves.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h2 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">GOVERNMENT REGULATION OF THE OIL AND GAS INDUSTRY</h2><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Company&#39;s exploration, production and marketing operations are regulated extensively at the federal, state and local levels, as well as by other countries in which the Company does business. Oil and gas exploration, development and production activities are subject to various laws and regulations governing a wide variety of matters. For example, hydrocarbon-producing states have statutes or regulations addressing conservation practices and the protection of correlative rights, and such regulations may affect Apache&#39;s operations and limit the quantity of hydrocarbons Apache may produce and sell. Other regulated matters include marketing, pricing, transportation, and valuation of royalty payments.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">At the U.S. federal level, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) regulates interstate transportation of natural gas under the Natural Gas Act. Effective January 1, 1993, the Natural Gas Wellhead Decontrol Act deregulated natural gas prices for all &quot;first sales&quot; of natural gas, which includes all sales by Apache of its own production. As a result, all sales of the Company&#39;s natural gas produced in the U.S. may be sold at market prices, unless otherwise committed by contract.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Apache&#39;s gas sales are affected by regulation of intrastate and interstate gas transportation. In an attempt to promote competition, the FERC has issued a series of orders, which have altered significantly the marketing and transportation of natural gas. The effect of these orders has been to enable the Company to market its natural gas production to purchasers other than the interstate pipelines located in the vicinity of its producing properties. The Company believes that these changes have generally improved the Company&#39;s access to transportation. To date, Apache has not experienced any material adverse effect on its gas marketing activities as a result of these FERC orders; however, the Company cannot predict what new regulations may be adopted by the FERC and other regulatory authorities, or what effect subsequent regulations may have on its future gas marketing activities.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h2 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS</h2><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Apache, as an owner or lessee and operator of oil and gas properties, is subject to various federal, provincial, state, local and foreign country laws and regulations relating to discharge of materials into, and protection of, the environment. These laws and regulations may, among other things, impose liability on the lessee under an oil and gas lease for the cost of pollution clean-up resulting from operations, subject the lessee to liability for pollution damages, and require suspension or cessation of operations in affected areas.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Apache maintains insurance coverage, which it believes is customary in the industry, although it is not fully insured against all environmental risks. The Company is not aware of any environmental claims existing as of December 31, 1998, which would have a material impact upon the Company&#39;s financial position or results of operations.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Apache has made and will continue to make expenditures in its efforts to comply with these requirements, which it believes are necessary business costs in the oil and gas industry. The Company has established policies for continuing compliance with environmental laws and regulations, including regulations applicable to its operations in Canada, Australia and other countries. Apache also has established operational procedures and training programs designed to minimize the environmental impact of its field facilities. The costs incurred by these policies and procedures are inextricably connected to normal operating expenses such that the Company is unable to separate the expenses related to environmental matters; however, the Company does not believe any such additional expenses are material to its financial position or results of operations.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">8</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Although environmental requirements have a substantial impact upon the energy industry, generally these requirements do not appear to affect Apache any differently, or to any greater or lesser extent, than other companies in the industry. Apache does not believe that compliance with federal, state, local or foreign country provisions regulating the discharge of materials into the environment, or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment, will have a material adverse effect upon the capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position of the Company or its subsidiaries; however, there is no assurance that changes in or additions to laws or regulations regarding the protection of the environment will not have such an impact.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h2 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">COMPETITION</h2><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The oil and gas industry is highly competitive. Because oil and gas are fungible commodities, the principal form of competition with respect to product sales is price competition. Apache strives to maintain the lowest finding and production costs possible to maximize profits.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">As an independent oil and gas company, Apache frequently competes for reserve acquisitions, exploration leases, licenses, concessions and marketing agreements against companies with financial and other resources substantially larger than Apache possesses. Moreover, many competitors have established strategic long-term positions and maintain strong governmental relationships in countries in which the Company may seek new entry.

The Company maintains insurance against certain losses or liabilities arising from its operations in accordance with customary industry practices and in amounts that management believes to be prudent; however, insurance is not available to the Company against all operational risks.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h2 style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">HEDGING</h2><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">To the extent that the Company engages in hedging activities, it may be prevented from realizing the benefits of price increases above the levels of the hedges. In addition, the Company is subject to basis risk when it engages in hedging transactions, particularly where transportation constraints restrict the Company&#39;s ability to deliver oil and gas volumes to the delivery point to which the hedging transaction is indexed.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h2 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">ACQUISITION RISKS</h2><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Company from time to time acquires oil and gas properties. Although the Company performs a review of the acquired properties that it believes is consistent with industry practices, such reviews are inherently incomplete. It generally is not feasible to review in depth every individual property involved in each acquisition. Ordinarily the Company will focus its review efforts on the higher-value properties and will sample the remainder. However, even a detailed review of records and properties may not necessarily reveal existing or potential problems, nor will it permit a buyer to become sufficiently familiar with the properties to assess fully their deficiencies and potential. Inspections may not always be performed on every well, and environmental problems, such as ground water contamination, are not necessarily observable even when an inspection is undertaken. Even when problems are identified, the Company often assumes certain environmental and other risks and liabilities in connection with acquired properties. There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved oil and gas reserves and actual future production rates and associated costs with respect to acquired properties, and actual results may vary substantially from those assumed in the estimates (see above). In addition, there can be no assurance that acquisitions will not have an adverse effect upon the Company&#39;s operating results, particularly during the periods in which the operations of acquired businesses are being integrated into the Company&#39;s ongoing operations.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">9</p><h2 style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS</h2><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Virtually all of the Company&#39;s operations are subject to the risks and uncertainties of adverse changes in general economic conditions (domestically, in specific regions of the United States and Canada, and internationally), the outcome of pending and/or potential legal or regulatory proceedings, changes in environmental, tax, labor and other laws and regulations to which the Company is subject, and the condition of the capital markets utilized by the Company to finance its operations.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h2 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">RISKS OF NON-U.S. OPERATIONS</h2><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Company&#39;s non-U.S. oil and natural gas exploration, development and production activities are subject to political and economic uncertainties (including but not limited to changes, sometimes frequent or marked, in governmental energy policies or the personnel administering them), expropriation of property, cancellation or modification of contract rights, foreign exchange restrictions, currency fluctuations, royalty and tax increases and other risks arising out of foreign governmental sovereignty over the areas in which the Company&#39;s operations are conducted, as well as risks of loss due to civil strife, acts of war, guerrilla activities and insurrection. These risks may be higher in the developing countries in which the Company conducts such activities. Consequently, the company&#39;s non-U.S. exploration, development and production activities may be substantially affected by factors beyond the Company&#39;s control, any of which could materially adversely affect the Company&#39;s financial position or results of operations. Furthermore, in the event of a dispute arising from non-U.S. operations, the Company may be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of courts outside the U.S. or may not be successful in subjecting non-U.S. persons to the jurisdiction of the courts in the U.S., which could adversely affect the outcome of such dispute.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h2 style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">EMPLOYEES</h2><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">On December 31, 1998, Apache had 1,281 employees.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h2 style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">OFFICES</h2><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Apache&#39;s principal executive offices are located at One Post Oak Central, 2000 Post Oak Boulevard, Suite 100, Houston, Texas 77056-4400.

In addition, if the Company engages in certain business combinations or a 20 percent shareholder engages in certain transactions with the Company, the Rights become exercisable for Apache common stock or common stock of the corporation acquiring the Company (as the case may be) at 50 percent of the then-market price. Any Rights that are or were beneficially owned by a person who has acquired 20 percent or more of the outstanding shares of Apache common stock and who engages in certain transactions or realizes the benefits of certain transactions with the Company will become void. The Company may redeem the Rights at $.01 per Right at any time until 10 business days after public announcement that a person has acquired 20 percent or more of the outstanding shares of Apache common stock. The Rights will expire on January 31, 2006, unless earlier redeemed by the Company. Unless the Rights have been previously redeemed, all shares of Apache common stock issued by the Company after January 31, 1996 will include Rights.

MANAGEMENT&#39;S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OVERVIEW</h2><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In anticipation of lower commodity prices, Apache entered 1998 with a primary objective being to strengthen its balance sheet in order to take advantage of lower cost drilling and acquisition opportunities that accompany cyclical downturns in product prices. To accomplish this, high cost properties were sold, drilling capital was curtailed, subordinated debentures were converted into common equity, and non-convertible preferred stock and public debt were issued. As a result of these efforts during 1998, Apache reduced debt by $160 million, from 47 percent to 43 percent of capitalization; the ratio would have been reduced to 41 percent absent the non-cash, full-cost ceiling write-down. Debt maturities were also lengthened to an average of 26 years with approximately three percent of Apache&#39;s total debt due over the next three years. As a result, Apache is in its strongest financial position ever to take advantage of opportunities brought about by the current industry downturn.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Apache&#39;s results of operations and financial position for 1998 were also significantly impacted by the following factors:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Additional Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization (DD&amp;A) Expense -- Low oil and gas prices resulted in a non-cash full-cost ceiling write- down of $158.1 million after-tax ($243.2 million pre-tax). There were no such charges in 1997 and 1996.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Commodity Prices -- Apache&#39;s average realized oil price decreased $6.54 per barrel from $19.20 per barrel in 1997 to $12.66 per barrel in 1998, reducing revenues by $158.9 million. The average realized price for natural gas decreased $.36 per Mcf from $2.28 per Mcf in 1997 to</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">$1.92 per Mcf in 1998, negatively impacting revenues by $78.6 million.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h2 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">RESULTS OF OPERATIONS</h2><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">Apache reported a 1998 loss attributable to common stock of $131.4 million as opposed to 1997 income attributable to common stock of</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">$154.9 million. The 1998 loss resulted from a full-cost ceiling write-down at year end. Results for 1998 were further hampered by sharp declines in oil and gas prices. Basic net income (loss) per common share was $(1.34) for 1998, as compared to $1.71 in 1997. Income attributable to common stock increased $33.5 million in 1997 from $121.4 million in 1996. Basic net income per common share increased 20 percent in 1997 from $1.42 in 1996. Diluted net income per common share was $1.65 for 1997, 20 percent above 1996. The increase from 1996 to 1997 was primarily due to higher oil and gas production, higher natural gas prices and lower operating costs per unit of production.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Revenues declined $300.6 million in 1998, driven by a 23 percent decrease in oil and gas production revenues. The decrease in oil and gas production revenues resulted from a 34 percent decrease in the average realized oil price, a 16 percent decrease in the average realized price for natural gas and a three percent decrease in gas production. Crude oil, including natural gas liquids, contributed 45 percent and natural gas contributed 55 percent of oil and gas production revenues during 1998. Revenues increased 20 percent in 1997 to $1.2 billion from $977.2 million in 1996. In 1997, crude oil and natural gas liquids contributed 49 percent and natural gas contributed 51 percent of oil and gas production revenues.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">18</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The table below presents, for the years indicated, the revenues, production and average prices received from sales of natural gas, oil and natural gas liquids.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Natural gas revenues decreased by 18 percent from 1997 to 1998 due to lower natural gas prices and production. The average realized gas price received in 1998 was $1.92 per Mcf, 16 percent lower than 1997, negatively affecting revenue by $78.6 million. The Company periodically engages in hedging activities, including fixed-price physical contracts and financial contracts. Apache realized gains from open hedging positions favorably impacting the gas price by $.01 per Mcf in 1998. Gains under long-term fixed-price physical contracts increased the gas price by $.05 per Mcf in 1998. Prices declined in the United States due to</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">19</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">unfavorable market conditions. Natural gas prices in Australia declined 15 percent from 1997 resulting from the devaluation of the Australian dollar.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Natural gas production for the United States decreased 12 percent from 1997 to 1998 due to the impact of property sales in the Gulf and Midcontinent regions, tropical storms in the Gulf of Mexico and natural depletion. In Australia, natural gas production increased 95 percent driven by a full year of incremental production from properties acquired in the year-end 1997 Ampolex Group Transaction. The 18 percent uplift in Canadian production resulted from development activity and Alberta royalty recoupments received for 1998. Alberta allows reduction in royalty for costs to build processing and transportation facilities.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Natural gas revenues increased 22 percent from 1996 to 1997. Average natural gas prices were $.26 per Mcf, or 13 percent, higher in 1997 than 1996. The Company&#39;s net hedging activity, including fixed-price physical contracts and financial contracts, had no impact on gas prices in 1997 and reduced prices by $.09 per Mcf in 1996. Natural gas production increased nine percent from 1996 to 1997 from acquisitions and drilling activity.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Company&#39;s crude oil sales totaled $336.8 million in 1998, a 28 percent decrease from 1997 due to lower average realized oil prices, which were partially offset by production increases. On a worldwide basis, average oil prices decreased 34 percent to $12.66 per barrel negatively impacting oil sales by $158.9 million. Oil production increased 6,359 barrels per day (approximately 10 percent), in 1998 due to increases in Egypt and Australia. Australian oil production increased 4,421 barrels per day over 1997 with additional production from the Ampolex Group Transaction and initial sales from the Stag field. Egyptian oil production increased 8,539 barrels per day, or 44 percent, as a result of the price- driven dynamics of certain production sharing contracts and to a lesser extent, drilling and development activity. U.S. oil production decreased by 6,571 barrels per day, or 16 percent, primarily due to marginal property sales in the first half of 1998 and natural reservoir depletion of mature fields.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Oil revenues increased 15 percent from 1996 to 1997. Egyptian oil production more than doubled in 1997 due to development activity and the first full year of production from the Company&#39;s Egyptian properties acquired in 1996. Australian oil production increased 90 percent from 1996 to 1997 primarily due to first production at the Agincourt field. These production increases were partially offset by an eight percent decrease in average oil prices received during 1997.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Natural gas liquid revenues decreased 30 percent from 1997. Natural gas liquid production increased 572 barrels per day, or 25 percent, while natural gas liquid prices declined by $6.14 per barrel, or 44 percent due to deteriorating market conditions. Natural gas liquid revenues were slightly higher in 1997 than in 1996. Natural gas liquid production increased 19 percent from 1996 to 1997, which was offset by a 14 percent decrease in average prices.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h2 style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">Other Revenues and Operating Expenses</h2><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Gas gathering, processing and marketing revenues decreased 40 percent to $117.4 million in 1998 from 1997. Lower gas prices in 1998 contributed to the decrease. Gas gathering, processing and marketing costs decreased by 41 percent to $114.5 million resulting in a slight increase to 1998 margins. During 1997, gas gathering, processing and marketing revenues increased 38 percent to $197.0 million. Lower margins were realized in 1997 as compared to 1996.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Equity in loss of affiliates represents Apache&#39;s share of ProEnergy losses. Equity in loss of affiliates was $1.6 million, $1.7 million and $.3 million in 1998, 1997 and 1996, respectively. Apache sold its 57 percent interest in ProEnergy in June 1998.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Recurring DD&amp;A expense increased marginally to $382.8 million in 1998 from $381.4 million in 1997. On an equivalent barrel basis, recurring full cost DD&amp;A expense decreased $.11 per boe, from $5.77 per boe in 1997 to $5.66 per boe in 1998. The Company&#39;s recurring DD&amp;A expense increased to $381.4 million in 1997 from $315.1 million in 1996. On an equivalent barrel basis, recurring full cost DD&amp;A expense increased $.33 per boe, from $5.44 per boe in 1996 to $5.77 per boe in 1997. Reserve revisions due to price declines and an increased cost environment in North America negatively impacted the 1997 rates.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">20</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Apache limits, on a country-by-country basis, the capitalized cost of proved oil and gas properties, net of accumulated DD&amp;A and deferred income taxes, to estimated future net cash flows from proved oil and gas reserves discounted at 10 percent, net of related tax effects, plus the lower of cost or fair value of unproved properties included in the costs being amortized. As a result of low oil and gas prices at December 31, 1998, Apache&#39;s capitalized costs of U.S. oil and gas properties exceeded the ceiling limitation and the Company reported a $243.2 million pre- tax ($158.1 million net of tax) non-cash write-down. No additional DD&amp;A was recorded during 1997 or 1996. If oil and gas prices deteriorate from the Company&#39;s year-end realized prices, it is likely that additional write-downs will occur in 1999. Write-downs required by these rules do not impact cash flow from operating activities.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Apache&#39;s operating costs decreased nine percent in 1998 to $211.6 million from $231.4 million in 1997. Lease operating expense (LOE), excluding severance taxes, decreased from $190.8 million in 1997 to $182.9 million in 1998. On an equivalent barrel basis, LOE for 1998 averaged $2.88 per boe, a $.19 decline from $3.07 per boe in 1997. Domestic per unit costs were significantly reduced by the sale of marginal North American properties, and by lower Western and Gulf region repairs and maintenance costs. Operating costs increased three percent to</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">$231.4 million in 1997 from $225.5 million in 1996. LOE, excluding severance taxes, increased from $186.4 million in 1996 to $190.8 million in 1997. LOE increased as a result of Egyptian oil production enhancements and North American gas production gains. On an equivalent barrel basis, LOE for 1997 averaged $3.07 per boe, a $.36 decline from $3.43 per boe in 1996.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Administrative, selling and other costs (G&amp;A) increased $2.5 million, or seven percent from 1997 to 1998. On an equivalent barrel basis, G&amp;A expense increased to $.64 per boe in 1998 compared to $.62 per boe in 1997. The increase in G&amp;A expense was primarily the result of employee separation payments associated with the sale of marginal North American properties. G&amp;A expense increased $2.3 million, or six percent, from 1996 to 1997. A new bonus plan initiated in 1997, under which Apache provided incentive compensation to all employees based on the achievement of targeted performance, was the primary reason for the increase. On an equivalent barrel basis, G&amp;A expense declined from $.66 per boe in 1996 to $.62 per boe in 1997. Production increases were not met with rising administrative costs.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Net financing costs for 1998 decreased $1.8 million, or two percent, from 1997 primarily due to higher capitalized interest. Gross interest expense increased $14.6 million due to a slightly higher interest rate on average outstanding debt in 1998 compared to 1997 and higher imputed interest on advances from gas purchasers. This was offset by an increase in capitalized interest, interest income and lower amortization of deferred loan costs. The Company&#39;s weighted average interest rate on outstanding debt was approximately 7.2 percent at December 31, 1998 compared to 7.1 percent at December 31, 1997. The capitalized interest increase is associated with Egyptian pipeline projects under construction. The increase in interest income was due to a higher average cash balance during 1998. Net financing costs for 1997 increased</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">$10.7 million, or 17 percent, over 1996. Gross interest expense increased by $15.3 million due to higher average aggregate debt outstanding at higher average interest rates, which resulted from the extension of Apache&#39;s debt maturities. In 1997, Apache wrote off $1.2 million in deferred loan costs related to the Company&#39;s election to cancel two secured credit facilities with the International Finance Corporation (IFC). Additional capitalized interest of $5.8 million in 1997 mitigated these increases. Capitalized interest associated with higher international unevaluated costs caused the increase in 1997.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h2 style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">MARKET RISK</h2><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h2 style="padding-left: 40pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">Commodity Risk</h2><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The Company&#39;s major market risk exposure is in the pricing applicable to its oil and gas production. Realized pricing is primarily driven by the prevailing worldwide price for crude oil and spot prices applicable to its United States and Canadian natural gas production. Historically, prices received for oil and gas production have been volatile and unpredictable. Pricing volatility is expected to continue. Oil price realizations ranged from a low of $9.42 per barrel to a high of $15.11 per barrel during 1998. Gas price realizations ranged from a monthly low of $1.73 per Mcf to a monthly high of $2.08 per Mcf during the same period.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">21</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Company periodically enters into hedging activities on a portion of its projected oil and natural gas production through a variety of financial and physical arrangements intended to support oil and natural gas prices at targeted levels and to manage its exposure to oil and gas price fluctuations. Apache may use futures contracts, swaps, options and fixed-price physical contracts to hedge its commodity prices. Realized gains or losses from the Company&#39;s price risk management activities are recognized in oil and gas production revenues when the associated production occurs. Apache does not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading purposes. In 1998, Apache recognized a net gain of $11.5 million from hedging activities that increased oil and gas production revenues. The net gain in 1998 includes $1.3 million in derivative income and $10.2 million in gains from fixed-price physical gas contracts. Gains or losses on natural gas derivative contracts are expected to be offset by sales at the spot market price or to preserve the margin on existing physical contracts. A 10 percent improvement in year-end spot market prices would increase the fair value of derivative contracts in effect at December 31, 1998 by $21.4 million, while a 10 percent drop in spot prices would decrease the fair value of these instruments by $21.4 million.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h2 style="padding-left: 40pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">Interest Rate Risk</h2><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Company considers its interest rate risk exposure to be minimal as a result of fixing interest rates on over three-fourths of the Company&#39;s debt. Total debt at December 31, 1998, included about $337.3 million of floating-rate debt. As a result, Apache&#39;s annual interest costs in 1999 will fluctuate based on short-term interest rates on approximately 25 percent of its total debt outstanding at December 31, 1998. The impact on annual cash flow of a 10 percent change in the floating rate (approximately 57 basis points) would be $1.9 million.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h2 style="padding-left: 40pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">Foreign Currency Risk</h2><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Company&#39;s cash flow stream relating to certain international operations is based on the U.S. dollar equivalent of cash flows measured in foreign currencies. Australian gas production is sold under fixed-price Australian dollar contracts and over half the costs incurred are paid in Australian dollars. Revenue and disbursement transactions denominated in Australian dollars are converted to U.S. dollar equivalents based on the exchange rate on the transaction date. Reported cash flow relating to Canadian operations is based on cash flows measured in Canadian dollars converted to the U.S. dollar equivalent based on the average of the Canadian and U.S. dollar exchange rates for the period reported.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">Substantially all of the Company&#39;s international transactions, outside of Canada and Australia, are denominated in U.S. dollars.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Company&#39;s Canadian and Australian subsidiaries have net financial obligations that are denominated in a currency other than the functional reporting currency of the subsidiaries. A decrease in value of 10 percent in the Australian and Canadian dollars relative to the U.S. dollar from the year-end exchange rates would result in a foreign currency loss of approximately $.4 million, based on December 31, 1998 amounts. The Company considers its current risk exposure to exchange rate movements, based on net cash flows, to be immaterial. The Company did not have any open derivative contracts relating to foreign currencies at December 31, 1998.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h2 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">CASH FLOW, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES</h2><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h2 style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">Capital Commitments</h2><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Apache&#39;s primary needs for cash are for exploration, development and acquisition of oil and gas properties, repayment of principal and interest on outstanding debt, payment of dividends, and capital obligations for affiliated ventures. The Company funds its exploration and development activities primarily through internally generated cash flows. Apache budgets capital expenditures based upon projected cash flows. The Company routinely adjusts its capital expenditures in response to changes in oil and natural gas prices and cash flow. The Company cannot accurately predict future product prices.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">22</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Capital Expenditures -- Apache&#39;s oil and gas capital expenditures over the last three years are summarized below:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Expenditures for exploration and development totaled $590.7 million in 1998 compared to $685.4 million in 1997. Apache&#39;s drilling program in 1998 added</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">105.6 MMboe of proved reserves (including revisions) and replaced 166 percent of production. In the United States, Apache completed 183 gross wells as producers out of 233 gross wells drilled during the year, compared with 261 gross producers out of 318 gross wells drilled in 1997. In Canada, Apache completed 47 gross wells as producers out of 66 gross wells drilled during the year, compared with 60 gross producers out of 81 gross wells drilled in 1997.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Internationally, the Company completed 46 gross producers out of 84 gross wells drilled in 1998, compared to 41 gross producers out of 73 gross wells in 1997. Successful international wells drilled in 1998 included 38 in Egypt, seven in Australia and one in China.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The total capital expenditures budget for 1999 is $270.0 million, including $122.8 million for North America. Estimated U.S. exploration and development expenditures for 1999 are $89.1 million, which includes $37.3 million in the Gulf region, $36.2 million in the Midcontinent region and $15.6 million in the Western region. Apache expects to spend $33.7 million in Canada in 1999. The Company expects its other international exploration and development expenditures in 1999, exclusive of facilities, to total approximately $109.9 million. Capital expenditures will be reviewed and possibly adjusted throughout the year in light of changing industry conditions.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">On November 13, 1998, the Company entered into agreements to acquire certain oil and gas interests and companies holding oil and gas interests in the Carnarvon Basin, Western Australia, from subsidiaries of Novus for approximately $55 million. The interests have proved reserves of approximately 5.8 MMboe and daily production of 2,400 barrels of oil equivalent. They are within the Apache-operated Harriet Joint Venture (which includes production, processing and pipeline infrastructure associated with the Varanus Island hub), the Airlie Joint Venture (in which the Company held a prior interest and became operator) and three other exploration permit areas. The transaction closed in two stages, on December 18, 1998 for approximately $49 million and on January 29, 1999 for approximately $6 million. Under the terms of an agreement with Novus, the Company may be required to make additional payments to Novus based on proved and probable recoverable oil and condensate reserves, as determined by independent engineers, on a defined geological structure in the Gipsy-Rose-Lee area, offshore Western Australia. If required, such payments would be calculated using $2.50 for each barrel of proved and $1.25 for each barrel of probable oil and condensate reserves. A payment becomes due if and when a decision is made to construct facilities for the production of oil or condensate from the designated area.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In 1998, the Company also completed tactical regional acquisitions for cash consideration totaling $19.4 million. These acquisitions added approximately 9.1 MMboe to the Company&#39;s reserves.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">On November 20, 1997, the Company acquired, in the Ampolex Group Transaction, all the capital stock of three companies owning interests in certain oil and gas properties (including 31.9 MMboe of proved oil and natural gas reserves) and production facilities offshore Western Australia for approximately $300 million</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">23</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">pursuant to three agreements with subsidiaries of Mobil. Funds for the Ampolex Group Transaction were obtained principally from borrowings under the Company&#39;s global credit facility.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Ampolex Group Transaction acquisition, net of the sale of certain properties to Hardy, increased the Company&#39;s interest to 47.5 percent from 22.5 percent in the Carnarvon Basin&#39;s Harriet area, which included the Varanus Island pipeline, processing and production complex and eight existing oil and gas fields. In addition, the Company&#39;s interest in the East Spar field, which produces through the Varanus Island facilities, increased to 45 percent from 20 percent. Apache operates both the Harriet and East Spar properties.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">In conjunction with the closing of the Ampolex Group Transaction on December 9, 1997, the Company entered into an agreement under which Hardy agreed to purchase a 10 percent interest in the Company&#39;s East Spar gas field and related production facilities in Western Australia. The transaction closed on January 28, 1998 with a total sales price of approximately $63 million in cash.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In 1997, the Company also completed 45 tactical regional acquisitions for cash consideration totaling $33.6 million. These acquisitions added approximately 6.6 MMboe to the Company&#39;s proved reserves.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Expenditures for acquisitions of proved oil and gas properties during 1996 totaled $446.2 million. The Company added 52 MMboe of proved oil and gas reserves through purchases in 1996. The most significant transaction completed in 1996 was the merger with Phoenix. Apache acquired oil and gas properties totaling $331.2 million from Phoenix. Apache also acquired $115.0 million of other oil and gas properties located primarily in the Company&#39;s existing focus areas. This amount included the purchase of certain oil and gas properties from Hall-Houston Oil Company for $46 million in cash. Funds for the acquisitions were obtained principally from borrowings under the Company&#39;s revolving bank credit facility.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Debt and Interest Commitments -- At December 31, 1998, Apache had outstanding debt of $153.0 million under its global credit facility and an aggregate of $1.2 billion of other debt. This other debt included notes and debentures maturing in the years 2000 through 2096. Debt outstanding at December 31, 1998 of $1.4 billion was comparable to the $1.5 billion outstanding at December 31, 1997. The Company&#39;s debt- to-capitalization ratio improved from 46.8 percent at December 31, 1997 to 43.0 percent at December 31, 1998. Interest payments on the Company&#39;s debt for 1999 are projected to be $129.0 million (using weighted average balances for floating rate obligations). Scheduled principal payments for 1999 total $15.5 million.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Dividend Payments -- Apache paid $1.0 million in dividends during 1998 on its Series B Preferred Stock issued in August 1998. Common dividends paid during 1998 totaled $27.2 million, up 8 percent from 1997, due to the increased number of common shares outstanding. The Company has paid cash dividends on its common stock for 128 consecutive quarters through December 31, 1998, and expects to continue payment of dividends at current levels. Future dividend payments will depend on the Company&#39;s level of earnings, financial requirements and other relevant factors.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h2 style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">Capital Resources and Liquidity</h2><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Company&#39;s primary capital resources are net cash provided by operating activities, proceeds from financing activities and proceeds from sales of non-strategic assets.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities -- Apache&#39;s net cash provided by operating activities during 1998 totaled $471.5 million, a decrease of 35 percent from the $723.8 million provided in 1997. This decrease was due primarily to lower oil and gas prices and lower gas production in 1998, offset by the receipt of $71.8 million from a purchaser as an advance. The advance was for future natural gas deliveries over a ten-year period commencing August 1998. Net cash provided by operating activities in 1997 rose $233.3 million from 1996 primarily due to higher product prices. The receipt of $115.2 million from a purchaser as an advance also impacted 1997 net cash provided by operating activities. This advance was for future natural gas deliveries of 20,000 MMBtu per day over a ten-year period commencing September 1997.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Long-Term Borrowings -- In February 1998, Apache issued $150 million principal amount, $148.2 million net of discount, of senior unsecured 7-percent notes maturing on February 1, 2018. The notes are not</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">24</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">redeemable prior to maturity. Net proceeds from the sale were used to reduce existing short-term obligations and for general corporate purposes.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In March 1999, Apache Finance Pty Ltd, the Company&#39;s Australian finance subsidiary, issued $100 million principal amount, $99.3 million net of discount, of senior unsecured 7.0-percent notes due March 15, 2009. The notes are irrevocably and unconditionally guaranteed by Apache. The Company has the right to redeem the notes prior to maturity, under certain conditions related to changes in relevant tax laws.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Stock Transactions -- In January 1998, approximately 90 percent, or $155.6 million, of the Company&#39;s 6-percent debentures were converted into 5.1 million shares of Apache common stock at a conversion price of $30.68 per share. The remaining $16.9 million principal amount was redeemed for $17.4 million in cash, plus accrued and unpaid interest. The Company recorded a $.8 million loss on the early extinguishment of debt in January 1998.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Preferred Stock Issuance -- In August 1998, Apache issued $100 million of Series B Preferred Stock. The net proceeds of approximately $98.4 million were used to repay debt outstanding under money market lines of credit and to reduce outstanding borrowings under the Canadian portion of the Company&#39;s global credit facility. The Series B Preferred Stock has no stated maturity, is not subject to a sinking fund and is not convertible into Apache common stock or any other securities of the Company. Apache has the option to redeem the Series B Preferred Stock at $1,000 per share on or after August 25, 2008.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Asset Sales -- Apache received $131.1 million in 1998 and $30.1 million in 1997 from the sale of non-strategic oil and gas properties in a number of separate transactions. An additional $63 million was received in 1998 for a 10 percent interest in Apache&#39;s East Spar field and related production facilities. These assets were reported as assets held for resale at December 31, 1997. The proceeds were used to reduce debt.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Liquidity -- The Company had $14.5 million in cash and cash equivalents on hand at December 31, 1998, up from $9.7 million at December 31, 1997. Apache&#39;s ratio of current assets to current liabilities decreased from 1.01:1 at December 31, 1997, to .74:1 at December 31, 1998.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Management believes that cash on hand, net cash generated from operations and unused committed borrowing capacity under its global credit facility will be adequate to satisfy the Company&#39;s financial obligations to meet future liquidity needs for at least the next two fiscal years. As of December 31, 1998, Apache&#39;s available borrowing capacity under its global credit facility was $788 million.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">25</p><h2 style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">IMPACT OF THE YEAR 2000 ISSUE</h2><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The inability of some computer programs and embedded computer chips to distinguish between the year 1900 and the year 2000 (the Year 2000 issue) poses a serious threat of business disruption to any organization that utilizes computer technology and computer chip technology in their business systems or equipment. Apache has formed a Year 2000 Task Force with representation from major business units to inventory and assess the risk associated with hardware, software, telecommunications systems, office equipment, embedded chip controls and systems, process control systems, facility control systems and dependencies on external trading partners. The project phases, expected completion dates and percentage complete as of March 1999 are as follows:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">To date, the Company is not aware of any significant Year 2000 issues that would cause problems in the area of safety, environmental or business interruption. The Company will assess the risks associated with hardware, software, infrastructure, embedded chips and external trading partners that are not Year 2000 compliant. While Apache is confident that Year 2000 remediation efforts will succeed in minimizing exposure to business disruption, plans are being developed that will allow continuation of business in all but the worst case scenarios. All remediation and replacement efforts and contingency planning are expected to be complete by September 1999. All critical external trading partners have been contacted to determine Year 2000 readiness and contingency plans will be developed where assurance of Year 2000 compliance is not received by March 31, 1999.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In 1997, the Company initiated a project to replace existing business software as it relates to Apache&#39;s production, land, marketing, accounting and financial systems to more effectively and efficiently meet its business needs. Replacement computer systems selected by the Company from SAP America, Inc., PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, Innovative Business Solutions and Landmark Graphics will properly recognize dates beyond December 31, 1999. The Company plans to implement the replacement software by March 31, 1999. The business system replacement project is 90 percent complete and the Company believes that the March 31, 1999 deadline is attainable.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Company expects the cost to achieve Year 2000 compliance will not exceed $4 million excluding the cost of implementing business replacement systems.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">26</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The Company presently believes that with conversions to new software and completion of efforts planned by the Year 2000 Task Force, the risk associated with Year 2000 will be significantly reduced. However, the Company is unable to assure that the consequences of Year 2000 failures of systems maintained by the Company or by third parties will not materially adversely impact the Company&#39;s results of operations, liquidity or financial condition.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h2 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">FUTURE TRENDS</h2><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Apache&#39;s strategy is to increase its oil and gas reserves, production, cash flow and earnings by continuing to explore on and develop its inventory of existing projects and making carefully targeted acquisitions of new assets. Crude oil prices have fallen to the lowest level in over a decade. Drilling costs and acquisition prices have also declined. As one of few companies to have reduced debt in 1998, Apache is well positioned to execute the second phase of its long-term strategy, which is to complete a meaningful acquisition in 1999 that builds shareholder value. Accordingly, Apache&#39;s 1999 plans include:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><ol id="l2"><li style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: -9pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">Controlling G&amp;A and LOE expense;</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p></li><li style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: -9pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">Curtailing drilling costs; and</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p></li><li style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: -9pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">Pursuing opportunities to acquire properties.</p></li></ol><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Although no specific opportunity has as yet been identified as likely, the Company believes that the number of quality acquisition, merger and joint venture opportunities has increased dramatically.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Apache&#39;s international properties should continue to grow in importance with respect to Apache&#39;s financial results and future growth prospects. Apache&#39;s international efforts remain focused on development of its discoveries in Egypt, offshore Western Australia, China and the Ivory Coast, and exploration efforts on the Company&#39;s concessions in Egypt and in Poland. While international exploration is recognized as higher risk than Apache&#39;s North American activities, the Company believes it offers potential for greater rewards and significant reserve additions.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Apache also believes that reserve additions in these international areas may be made through higher risk exploration and through improved production practices and recovery techniques.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Under the full cost accounting rules of the SEC, the Company reviews the carrying value of its proved oil and gas properties each quarter on a country-by-country basis. Under these rules, capitalized costs of proved oil and gas properties, net of accumulated DD&amp;A and deferred income taxes, may not exceed the present value of estimated future net cash flows from proved oil and gas reserves, discounted at 10 percent, plus the lower of cost or fair value of unproved properties included in the costs being amortized, net of related tax effects. These rules generally require pricing future oil and gas production at the unescalated oil and gas prices in effect at the end of each fiscal quarter and require a write-down if the &quot;ceiling&quot; is exceeded, even if prices declined for only a short period of time. The Company recorded a $243.2 million pre-tax ($158.1 million net of tax) non-cash write-down of the carrying value of the Company&#39;s U.S. proved oil and gas properties as of December 31, 1998, due to these ceiling test limitations. If oil and gas prices deteriorate from the Company&#39;s year-end realized prices, it is likely that additional write-downs will occur in 1999. Write-downs required by these rules do not impact cash flow from operating activities.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h2 style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS AND RISK</h2><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Certain statements in this report, including statements of the future plans, objectives, and expected performance of the Company, are forward- looking statements that are dependent upon certain events, risks and uncertainties that may be outside the Company&#39;s control, and which could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated. Some of these include, but are not limited to, the market prices of oil and gas, economic and competitive conditions, inflation rates, legislative and regulatory changes, financial market conditions, political and economic uncertainties of foreign governments, future business decisions, and other uncertainties, all of which are difficult to predict.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved oil and gas reserves and in projecting future rates of production and the timing of development expenditures. The total amount or timing</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">27</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">of actual future production may vary significantly from reserves and production estimates. The drilling of exploratory wells can involve significant risks, including those related to timing, success rates and cost overruns. Lease and rig availability, complex geology and other factors can affect these risks. Although Apache makes use of futures contracts, swaps, options and fixed-price physical contracts to mitigate risk, fluctuations in oil and gas prices, or a prolonged continuation of the current low price of crude oil, may substantially adversely affect the Company&#39;s financial position, results of operations and cash flows.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h2 style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">ITEM 8.

The Company&#39;s North American exploration and production activities are divided into three U.S. operating regions (Gulf, Midcontinent and Western), plus a Canadian region. Approximately 62 percent of the Company&#39;s proved reserves are located in North America. Internationally, Apache has exploration and production interests in Egypt, offshore Western Australia and offshore Ivory Coast, and exploration interests in Poland and offshore The People&#39;s Republic of China (China).</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Company&#39;s future financial condition and results of operations will depend upon prices received for its oil and natural gas production and the costs of finding, acquiring, developing and producing reserves. A substantial portion of the Company&#39;s production is sold under market- sensitive contracts. Prices for oil and natural gas are subject to fluctuations in response to changes in supply, market uncertainty and a variety of other factors beyond the Company&#39;s control. These factors include worldwide political instability (especially in the Middle East), the foreign supply of oil and natural gas, the price of foreign imports, the level of consumer demand, and the price and availability of alternative fuels.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">With natural gas accounting for 56 percent of Apache&#39;s 1998 production on an energy equivalent basis, the Company is affected more by fluctuations in natural gas prices than in oil prices.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Principles of Consolidation -- The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Apache and its subsidiaries after elimination of intercompany balances and transactions. The Company&#39;s interests in oil and gas exploration and production ventures and partnerships are proportionately consolidated. Apache&#39;s investment in Producers Energy Marketing LLC (ProEnergy) and a pipeline partnership in Western Australia are accounted for using the equity method for the periods of ownership. Certain reclassifications have been made to the 1997 and 1996 financial statements to conform to the classifications used in the current year.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Cash Equivalents -- The Company considers all highly liquid debt instruments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. These investments are carried at cost, which approximates market.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Inventories -- Inventories consist principally of tubular goods and production equipment, stated at the lower of weighted average cost or market, and oil produced but not sold, stated at current market value net of costs to sell.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Property and Equipment -- The Company uses the full cost method of accounting for its investment in oil and gas properties. Under this method, the Company capitalizes all acquisition, exploration and development costs incurred for the purpose of finding oil and gas reserves, including salaries, benefits and other internal costs directly attributable to these activities. Exclusive of field-level costs, Apache capitalized</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">$12.2 million, $11.9 million and $12.1 million of internal costs in 1998, 1997 and 1996, respectively. Costs associated with production and general corporate activities are expensed in the period incurred. Internal costs attributable to the management of the Company&#39;s producing properties, before recoveries from industry partners, totaled $23.1 million, $22.5 million and $17.0 million in 1998, 1997, and 1996, respectively, and are included in operating costs in the Company&#39;s statement of consolidated operations. Interest costs related to unproved properties and properties under development are also capitalized to oil and gas properties. Unless a significant portion of the Company&#39;s reserve quantities are sold (greater than 25 percent), proceeds from the sale of oil and gas properties are accounted for as reductions to capitalized costs, and gains and losses are not recognized.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Apache computes the provision for recurring depreciation, depletion and amortization (DD&amp;A) of oil and gas properties on a quarterly basis using the unit-of-production method based upon production and estimates of proved reserve quantities. Unevaluated costs and related capitalized interest costs are excluded</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">F-7</p><h2 style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 184pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">APACHE CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES</h2><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h2 style="padding-left: 122pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- (CONTINUED)</h2><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">from the amortization base until the properties associated with these costs are evaluated. The amortizable base includes estimated future development costs and dismantlement, restoration and abandonment costs, net of estimated salvage values. These future costs are generally estimated by engineers employed by Apache.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Apache limits, on a country-by-country basis, the capitalized costs of proved oil and gas properties, net of accumulated DD&amp;A and deferred income taxes, to the estimated future net cash flows from proved oil and gas reserves discounted at 10 percent, net of related tax effects, plus the lower of cost or fair value of unproved properties included in the costs being amortized. If capitalized costs exceed this limit, the excess is charged to additional DD&amp;A expense. Included in the estimated future net cash flows are Canadian provincial tax credits expected to be realized beyond the date at which the legislation, under its provisions, could be repealed. To date, the Canadian provincial government has not indicated an intention to repeal this legislation.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">As a result of low oil and gas prices at December 31, 1998, Apache&#39;s capitalized costs of U.S. oil and gas properties exceeded the ceiling limitation and the Company reported a $243.2 million pre-tax ($158.1 million net of tax) non-cash write-down. The write-down is reflected as additional DD&amp;A expense in the accompanying statement of consolidated operations.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The costs of certain unevaluated leasehold acreage and wells being drilled are not being amortized. Costs not being amortized are periodically assessed for possible impairments or reductions in value. If a reduction in value has occurred, costs being amortized are increased or a charge is made against earnings for those international operations where a reserve base is not yet established.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Buildings, equipment and gas gathering, transmission and processing facilities are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which range from two to 15 years. Accumulated depreciation for these assets totaled $70.0 million and $51.8 million at December 31, 1998 and 1997, respectively.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Accounts Payable -- Included in accounts payable at December 31, 1998 and 1997, are liabilities of approximately $24.0 million and $36.3 million, respectively, representing the amount by which checks issued, but not presented to the Company&#39;s banks for collection, exceeded balances in applicable bank accounts.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Revenue Recognition -- Apache uses the sales method of accounting for natural gas revenues. Under this method, revenues are recognized based on actual volumes of gas sold to purchasers. The volumes of gas sold may differ from the volumes to which Apache is entitled based on its interests in the properties. Differences between volumes sold and entitled volumes create gas imbalances which are generally reflected as adjustments to reported proved gas reserves and future cash flows in the Company&#39;s supplemental oil and gas disclosures. Adjustments for gas imbalances totaled approximately one percent of Apache&#39;s proved gas reserves at December 31, 1998. Revenue is deferred and a liability is recorded for those properties where the estimated remaining reserves will not be sufficient to enable the underproduced owner to recoup its entitled share through production.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities -- Apache periodically enters into commodity derivatives contracts and fixed-price physical contracts to manage its exposure to oil and gas price volatility. Commodity derivatives contracts, which are usually placed with major financial institutions that the Company believes are minimal credit risks, may take the form of futures contracts, swaps or options. The oil and gas reference prices upon which these commodity derivatives contracts are based reflect various market indices that have a high degree of historical correlation with actual prices received by the Company. The Company accounts for its commodity derivatives contracts using the hedge (or deferral) method of accounting. Under this method, realized gains and losses from the Company&#39;s price risk management activities are recognized in oil and gas production revenues when the associated production occurs and the resulting cash flows are reported as cash flows from operating activities. Gains and losses on commodity derivatives contracts that are closed before the hedged production occurs are deferred until the production month originally hedged. In the event of a loss of correlation between changes in oil and gas reference prices under a commodity derivatives contract and actual</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">F-8</p><h2 style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 184pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">APACHE CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES</h2><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h2 style="padding-left: 122pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- (CONTINUED)</h2><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">oil and gas prices, a gain or loss is recognized currently to the extent the commodity derivatives contract has not offset changes in actual oil and gas prices.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In June 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 133, &quot;Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities.&quot; SFAS No. 133 establishes accounting and reporting standards requiring that every derivative instrument (including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts) be recorded in the balance sheet as either an asset or liability measured at its fair value, and requires that changes in a derivative&#39;s fair value be recognized currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met. Special accounting for qualifying hedges allows a derivative&#39;s gains and losses to offset related results on the hedged item in the statement of consolidated operations, and requires that a company formally document, designate, and assess the effectiveness of transactions that receive hedge accounting treatment. SFAS No. 133 is required to be adopted on January 1, 2000, although earlier adoption is permitted. The Company is analyzing the effects of SFAS No. 133, but has not yet quantified the impact on its financial statements or determined the timing or method of adoption. Management does not believe that the adoption of SFAS No. 133 will have a material impact on the Company&#39;s financial condition or results of operations.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Income Taxes -- The Company follows the liability method of accounting for income taxes under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences of (i) temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements and (ii) operating loss and tax credit carryforwards for tax purposes. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, based upon management&#39;s estimates, it is more likely than not that a portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized in a future period.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Foreign Currency Translation -- The U.S. dollar is considered the functional currency for each of the Company&#39;s international operations, except for its Canadian subsidiary whose functional currency is the Canadian dollar. Translation adjustments resulting from translating the Canadian subsidiary&#39;s foreign currency financial statements into U.S. dollar equivalents are reported separately and accumulated in other comprehensive income. For other international operations, transaction gains or losses are recognized in net income.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Net Income (Loss) Per Common Share -- Basic and diluted net income (loss) per common share have been computed in accordance with SFAS No. 128, &quot;Earnings per Share.&quot; Basic net income (loss) per common share is computed by dividing income (loss) attributable to common stock by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted net income per common share reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised or converted into common stock. Diluted net loss per common share does not reflect dilution from potential common shares, because to do so would have been antidilutive. Calculations of basic and diluted net income (loss) per common share are illustrated in Note 7.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Stock-Based Compensation -- The Company accounts for employee stock-based compensation using the intrinsic value method prescribed by Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 25, &quot;Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees&quot; and related interpretations. Nonemployee stock-based compensation is accounted for using the fair value method in accordance with SFAS No. 123, &quot;Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation.&quot;</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Comprehensive Income -- In the first quarter of 1998, the Company adopted SFAS No. 130, &quot;Reporting Comprehensive Income,&quot; which requires companies to report the components of comprehensive income in a financial statement with the same prominence as other financial statements. The Company has chosen to disclose comprehensive income, which is comprised of net income (loss) and foreign currency translation adjustments, in the accompanying statement of consolidated shareholders&#39; equity. This information is shown for all periods presented.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">F-9</p><h2 style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 184pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">APACHE CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES</h2><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h2 style="padding-left: 122pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- (CONTINUED)</h2><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Segment Information -- In June 1997, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS No. 131, &quot;Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information&quot; which established standards for the way that enterprises report information about operating segments and related information. The Company adopted the disclosure requirements of SFAS No. 131 at year-end 1998 and restated prior-year comparative information.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Use of Estimates -- The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Significant estimates with regard to these financial statements include the estimate of proved oil and gas reserve quantities and the related present value of estimated future net cash flows therefrom (see supplemental oil and gas disclosures).</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p></li><li style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: -9pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">ACQUISITIONS AND DIVESTITURES</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h2 style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">Acquisitions</h2><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">On November 13, 1998, the Company entered into agreements to acquire certain oil and gas interests and companies holding oil and gas interests in the Carnarvon Basin, offshore Western Australia, from subsidiaries of Novus Petroleum Limited (Novus) for approximately $55 million. The interests have estimated proved reserves of approximately 5.8 MMboe and daily production of 2,400 barrels of oil equivalent. They are within the Apache-operated Harriet Joint Venture (which includes production, processing and pipeline infrastructure associated with the Varanus Island hub), the Airlie Joint Venture (in which the Company held a prior interest and became operator) and three other exploration permit areas. The transaction closed in two stages, on December 18, 1998 (approximately $49 million) and on January 29, 1999 (approximately</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">$6 million). Under the terms of an agreement with Novus, the Company may be required to make additional payments to Novus based on proved and probable recoverable oil and condensate reserves, as determined by independent engineers, on a defined geological structure in the Gipsy-Rose-Lee area, offshore Western Australia. If required, such payments would be calculated using $2.50 for each barrel of proved and</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">$1.25 for each barrel of probable oil and condensate reserves. A payment becomes due if and when a decision is made to construct facilities for the production of oil or condensate from the designated area.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The purchase price for the portion of the transaction completed in 1998 was allocated to the assets purchased and the liabilities assumed based upon the fair values on the date of acquisition, as follows:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In 1998, the Company also completed tactical regional acquisitions for cash consideration totaling $19.4 million. These acquisitions added approximately 9.1 MMboe to the Company&#39;s proved reserves.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">In November 1997, the Company acquired all the capital stock of three companies owning interests in certain oil and gas properties (including</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">31.9 MMboe of proved oil and natural gas reserves) and production facilities offshore Western Australia for approximately $300 million from subsidiaries of Mobil Exploration &amp; Producing Australia Pty Ltd (Ampolex Group Transaction). The Ampolex Group Transaction, net of the subsequent sale of certain properties to Hardy Petroleum Limited (Hardy), increased the Company&#39;s interest to 47.5 percent from 22.5 percent in the Carnarvon Basin&#39;s Harriet area, which includes the Varanus Island</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">F-10</p><h2 style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 184pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">APACHE CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES</h2><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h2 style="padding-left: 122pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- (CONTINUED)</h2><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">pipeline, processing and production complex and eight existing oil and gas fields. The transaction also increased the Company&#39;s interest in the East Spar field, which produces through the Varanus Island facilities, to 45 percent from 20 percent. Apache operates the Harriet and East Spar properties.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The purchase price was allocated to the assets purchased and the liabilities assumed based upon the fair values on the date of acquisition, as follows:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In conjunction with the closing of the Ampolex Group Transaction, the Company entered into an agreement with Hardy on December 9, 1997, under which Hardy agreed to purchase a 10 percent interest in the Company&#39;s East Spar field and related production facilities. The transaction closed on January 28, 1998, with a total sales price of approximately $63 million in cash. The assets sold to Hardy were reported as assets held for resale in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 1997.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In 1997, the Company also completed tactical regional acquisitions for cash consideration totaling $33.6 million. These acquisitions added approximately 6.6 MMboe to the Company&#39;s proved reserves.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In May 1996, Apache acquired, for approximately $396.3 million, The Phoenix Resource Companies, Inc. (Phoenix, now known as Apache PHN Company, Inc.), an oil and gas company operating primarily in the Arab Republic of Egypt, through a merger (Phoenix Merger) which resulted in Phoenix becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of Apache. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, shares of Phoenix common stock then outstanding and outstanding Phoenix stock options (which were assumed by Apache) were converted into the right to receive (a) .75 shares of Apache common stock with any fractional shares paid in cash, without interest, and (b) $4.00 in cash. As a result, 12.2 million shares of Apache common stock, valued at $26 per share, were issued and approximately $65 million was paid to former Phoenix shareholders.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In 1996, the Company also completed tactical regional acquisitions for cash consideration totaling $115.0 million. These acquisitions added approximately</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">18.9 MMboe to the Company&#39;s proved reserves.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Each transaction described above has been accounted for using the purchase method of accounting and has been included in the financial statements of Apache since the date of acquisition.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The following unaudited pro forma financial information shows the effect on the Company&#39;s consolidated results of operations as if the Phoenix Merger occurred on January 1, 1996.

The global credit facility consists of three separate bank facilities: a $700 million facility in the United States; a $175 million facility in Australia; and a $125 million facility in Canada. The global credit facility enables Apache to draw on the entire $1 billion facility without restrictions tied to periodic revaluation of the Company&#39;s oil and gas reserves. As of December 31, 1998, Apache&#39;s available borrowing capacity under the global credit facility was $788 million. Under the financial covenants of the global credit facility, the Company must (i) maintain a consolidated tangible net worth, as defined, of at least $1.1 billion as of December 31, 1998, which is adjusted for subsequent earnings, and (ii) maintain a ratio of debt to capitalization of not greater than 60 percent at the end of any fiscal quarter. The Company was in compliance with all financial covenants at December 31, 1998.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The global credit facility is scheduled to mature on June 12, 2002, in the amount of $40 million and the remaining $960 million on June 12, 2003. The agreement provides for perpetual one-year extensions as requested by the Company, subject to the approval of the lenders. At the Company&#39;s option, the interest rate is based on (i) the greater of (a) The Chase Manhattan Bank&#39;s prime rate or (b) the federal funds rate plus one-half of one percent, (ii) the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus a margin determined by the Company&#39;s senior long-term debt rating, or (iii) a margin that is determined by competitive bids from the participating banks. At December 31, 1998, the margin over LIBOR for committed loans was .185 percent. The Company also pays a quarterly facility fee of .09 percent on the total amount of each of the three facilities, which fee varies based upon the Company&#39;s senior long-term debt rating.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">At December 31, 1998, the Company also had certain uncommitted money market lines of credit which are used from time to time for working capital purposes. As of December 31, 1998, an aggregate of $15.5 million was outstanding under such credit lines.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In January 1997, the Company established a $300 million commercial paper program which enables Apache to borrow funds for up to 270 days at competitive interest rates. In June 1997, Apache expanded its commercial paper program to $700 million from $300 million to provide access to additional low-cost, short- term funds. Since its inception in January 1997, the Company&#39;s commercial paper program has been rated A-2, Prime-2 and D-1- (D-One-Minus) by Standard &amp; Poor&#39;s, Moody&#39;s and Duff and Phelps, respectively. As of December 31, 1998, $59.0 million was outstanding under Apache&#39;s commercial paper program. The commercial paper is classified as long-term debt in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as the Company has the ability and intent to refinance such amounts on a long-term basis through either the rollover of commercial paper or available borrowing capacity under the global credit facility.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In January 1998, approximately 90 percent, or $155.6 million, of the Company&#39;s 6-percent convertible subordinated debentures was converted into approximately 5.1 million shares of Apache common stock at a conversion price of $30.68 per share. The remaining $16.9 million of principal amount was redeemed for $17.4 million in cash, plus accrued and unpaid interest.

The facility provides for total commitments of $250 million, with availability determined by a borrowing base formula predicated upon those subsidiaries&#39; oil and gas reserve quantities, forecast rates of production, and future oil and gas prices. The borrowing base is $121.8 million at December 31, 1998 and will be redetermined semi-annually. The total amount of commitments under the facility is currently scheduled to be reduced by set increments every six months, beginning two and one-half years after the effective date of the facility. The facility is presently secured solely by assets associated with the Company&#39;s Qarun and Khalda concessions and shares of stock of the Company&#39;s subsidiaries holding those concessions, with provisions that will permit the inclusion of other of the Company&#39;s Egyptian subsidiaries as borrowers with security interests on such subsidiaries&#39; assets and shares of stock. Interest is assessed at LIBOR plus a margin of .375 percent, which is scheduled to increase to .625 percent on the third anniversary of the facility; however, if the facility is extended the rate increase would occur two years from the end of the facility&#39;s extended term. A quarterly fee of .375 percent is payable on the available portion of the commitments, while a quarterly fee of .1875 percent is payable on the difference between the borrowing base and the total amount of commitments under the facility.

The Appreciation Plan provides for conditional grants denominated in shares of Apache common stock that vest upon attainment of share price goals of $50 and $60 per share before January 1, 2000. Between 30 and 50 percent of the conditional grants will be paid in cash at the market value of the stock on the date of payment, and the balance (up to a total of 2,000,000 shares in the aggregate) will be issued in Apache common stock. Generally, any vested amounts will be distributed in three installments over the 36-month period following attainment of the share price goals. When and if the share price goals are achieved, the Company will recognize compensation expense over the 36-month period equal to the value of the stock as of the date the share price goal is achieved (i.e., $50 or $60 per share, as appropriate) and the actual amount of cash paid. The shares of Apache common stock contingently issuable under the Appreciation Plan will be excluded from the computation of net income (loss) per common share until the stated share price goals of $50 and $60 per share are achieved.

The Series B Preferred Stock has no stated maturity, is not subject to a sinking fund and is not convertible into Apache common stock or any other securities of the Company. Apache has the option to redeem the Series B Preferred Stock at $1,000 per share on or after August 25, 2008. Holders of the shares are entitled to receive cumulative cash dividends at an annual rate of $5.68 per depositary share when, and if, declared by Apache&#39;s board of directors. The net proceeds of approximately $98.4 million were used to repay debt outstanding under money market lines of credit and to reduce outstanding borrowings under the Canadian portion of the Company&#39;s global credit facility.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Rights to Purchase Series A Preferred Stock -- In December 1995, the Company declared a dividend of one right (a Right) for each share of Apache common stock outstanding on January 31, 1996. Each Right entitles the registered holder to purchase from the Company one ten- thousandth (1/10,000) of a share of Series A Preferred Stock at a price of $100 per one ten-thousandth of a share, subject to adjustment. The Rights are exercisable 10 calendar days following a public announcement that certain persons or groups have acquired 20 percent or more of the outstanding shares of Apache common stock or 10 business days following commencement of an offer for 30 percent or more of the outstanding shares of Apache common stock. In addition, if the Company engages in certain business combinations or a 20 percent shareholder engages in certain transactions with the Company, the Rights become exercisable for Apache common stock or common stock of the corporation acquiring the Company (as the case may be) at 50 percent of the then-market price.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">F-21</p><h2 style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 184pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">APACHE CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES</h2><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h2 style="padding-left: 122pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- (CONTINUED)</h2><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Any Rights that are or were beneficially owned by a person who has acquired 20 percent or more of the outstanding shares of Apache common stock and who engages in certain transactions or realizes the benefits of certain transactions with the Company will become void.

The fair values of the 9.875-percent notes and 7.625-percent debentures are, and the 6-percent convertible subordinated debentures were, based upon estimates provided to the Company by independent investment banking firms. The carrying amount of the bank debt, commercial paper and money market lines of credit approximates fair value because the interest rates are variable and reflective of market rates.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Commodity Price Hedges -- Apache periodically enters into commodity derivative contracts and fixed-price physical contracts to manage its exposure to oil and gas price volatility. Commodity derivatives contracts, which are usually placed with major financial institutions that the Company believes are minimal credit risks, may take the form of futures contracts, swaps or options. The derivative contracts call for Apache to receive, or make, payments based upon the differential between a fixed and a variable commodity price as specified in the contract. As a result of these activities, Apache recognized hedging gains of $1.3 million and $14.5 million in 1998 and 1997, respectively, and hedging losses of $23.0 million in 1996. The hedging gains and losses are included in oil and gas production revenues in the statement of consolidated operations.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Apache&#39;s consolidated balance sheet includes deferred credits totaling $1.0 million and $2.2 million at December 31, 1998 and 1997, respectively, for gains realized on the early termination of commodity derivative contracts in 1998 and prior years. These gains will be recognized as oil and gas production revenues over periods ranging from one to 12 months as the hedged production occurs.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The following table and note thereto cover the Company&#39;s pricing and notional volumes on open natural gas commodity derivative contracts as of December 31, 1998:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 2pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="194" height="3" alt="image" src="NYSE_APA_1999/Image_012.png"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">(1) The Company has various contracts to supply gas at fixed prices.

These laws and regulations may, among other things, impose liability on the lessee under an oil and gas lease for the cost of pollution clean-up resulting from operations and subject the lessee to liability for pollution damages. Apache maintains insurance coverage, which it believes, is customary in the industry, although it is not fully insured against all environmental risks.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">As part of the Company&#39;s due diligence review for acquisitions, Apache conducts an extensive environmental evaluation of purchased properties. Depending on the extent of an identified environmental problem, the Company may exclude a property from the acquisition, require the seller to remediate the property to Apache&#39;s satisfaction, or agree to assume liability for remediation of the property. As of December 31, 1998, Apache had a reserve for environmental remediation of approximately $6.1 million. The Company is not aware of any environmental claims existing as of December 31, 1998, which have not been provided for or would otherwise have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations. There can be no assurance, however, that current regulatory requirements will not change, or past non-compliance with environmental laws will not be discovered on the Company&#39;s properties.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">International Commitments -- The Company, through its subsidiaries, has acquired or has been conditionally or unconditionally granted exploration rights in Australia, Egypt, China, Poland and the Ivory Coast. In order to comply with the contracts and agreements granting these rights, the Company, through various wholly-owned subsidiaries, is committed to expend approximately $154.5 million through 2002.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Retirement and Deferred Compensation Plans -- The Company provides a 401(k) savings plan for employees which allows participating employees to elect to contribute up to 12 percent of their salaries, with Apache making matching contributions up to a maximum of six percent of each employee&#39;s salary. In addition, the Company annually contributes six percent of each participating employee&#39;s compensation, as defined, to a money purchase retirement plan. The 401(k) plan and the money purchase retirement plan are subject to certain annually-adjusted, government-mandated restrictions which limit the amount of each employee&#39;s contributions.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">For certain eligible employees, the Company also provides a non-qualified retirement/savings plan which allows the deferral of up to 50 percent of each such employee&#39;s salary, and which accepts employee contributions and the Company&#39;s matching contributions in excess of the above-referenced restrictions on the 401(k) savings plan and money purchase retirement plan.

After certification and the finalization of certain documentation related to the partnership&#39;s debt, partnership debt will be non-recourse to Apache. The Company has dedicated the production volumes of six take-or-pay gas sales contracts to the pipeline. Apache will be required to prepay transportation tariffs in the event Apache receives payments under the take-or-pay provisions of these contracts, or in the event the Company fails to deliver the volumes required by the contracts and requested by the purchasers.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p></li><li style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">TRANSACTIONS WITH RELATED PARTIES AND MAJOR CUSTOMERS</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Strategic Alliance with Cinergy -- In June 1998, Apache formed a strategic alliance with Cinergy to market substantially all the Company&#39;s natural gas production from North America and sold its 57 percent interest in ProEnergy for 771,258 shares of Cinergy common stock subsequently sold for $26.1 million. ProEnergy will continue to market Apache&#39;s North American natural gas production for 10 years, with an option to terminate after six years, under an amended and restated gas purchase agreement effective July 1, 1998. During this period, Apache is generally obligated to deliver most of its North American gas production to Cinergy and, under certain circumstances, reimburse Cinergy if certain gas throughput thresholds are not met. Accordingly, Apache recorded a deferred gain of $20.0 million, subject to adjustment, on the sale of ProEnergy that is being amortized over six years.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Related Parties -- F.H. Merelli, a member of the Company&#39;s board of directors since July 1997, is chairman, president and chief executive officer of Key Production Company, Inc. (Key). In the normal course of business, Key paid to Apache during 1998 approximately $7.7 million for Key&#39;s proportionate share of drilling and workover costs, mineral interests and routine expenses relating to 369 oil and gas wells in which Key owns interests and for which Apache is the operator. Key received approximately $5.7 million in 1998 for its proportionate share of revenues from such interests, of which approximately $3.4 million was paid directly to Key by Apache or related entities.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Major Purchasers -- In 1998, purchases by ProEnergy and the Egyptian General Petroleum Corporation (EGPC) accounted for 38 percent and 17 percent of the Company&#39;s oil and gas production revenues, respectively. In 1997, purchases by ProEnergy and EGPC accounted for 40 percent and 13 percent of the Company&#39;s oil and gas production revenues, respectively. In 1996, purchases by ProEnergy accounted for 35 percent of the Company&#39;s oil and gas production revenues.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">F-26</p><h2 style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 184pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">APACHE CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES</h2><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h2 style="padding-left: 122pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- (CONTINUED)</h2><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Concentration of Credit Risk -- The Company&#39;s revenues are derived principally from uncollateralized sales to customers in the oil and gas industry; therefore, customers may be similarly affected by changes in economic and other conditions within the industry. Apache has not experienced significant credit losses on such sales. Sales of natural gas by Apache to ProEnergy are similarly uncollateralized.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p></li><li style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">BUSINESS SEGMENT INFORMATION</p></li></ol><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Apache has five reportable segments which are primarily in the business of natural gas and crude oil exploration and production.

Estimates of future liabilities and receivables applicable to oil and gas commodity hedges are reflected in future cash flows from proved reserves with such estimates based on prices in effect as of the date of the reserve report. Fluctuations are largely due to supply and demand perceptions for natural gas and volatility in oil prices.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Under the full cost accounting rules of the SEC, the Company reviews the carrying value of its proved oil and gas properties each quarter on a country-by-country basis. Under these rules, capitalized costs of proved oil and gas properties, net of accumulated DD&amp;A and deferred income taxes, may not exceed the present value of estimated future net cash flows from proved oil and gas reserves, discounted at 10 percent, plus the lower of cost or fair value of unproved properties included in the costs being amortized, net of related tax effects. These rules generally require pricing future oil and gas production at the unescalated oil and gas prices at the end of each fiscal quarter and require a write-down if the &quot;ceiling&quot; is exceeded, even if prices declined for only a short period of time. The Company recorded a $243.2 million pre-tax ($158.1 million net of tax) non-cash write-down of the carrying value of Apache&#39;s U.S. proved oil and gas properties as of December 31, 1998, due to these ceiling test limitations. If oil and gas prices deteriorate from the Company&#39;s year-end realized prices, it is likely that additional write-downs will occur in 1999. Write-downs required by these rules do not impact cash flow from operating activities.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">F-34</p><h2 style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 184pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">APACHE CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES</h2><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h2 style="padding-left: 174pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">SUPPLEMENTAL QUARTERLY FINANCIAL DATA</h2><p style="padding-left: 40pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: center;">(UNAUDITED)</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 2pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="194" height="3" alt="image" src="NYSE_APA_1999/Image_016.png"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><ol id="l9"><li style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">The sum of the individual quarterly net income (loss) per common share amounts may not agree with year-to-date net income (loss) per common share as each quarterly computation is based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during that period.

No amendment to the Code, other than a change in the percentage of the dividends received deduction set forth in Section 243(a)(1) of the Code or any successor provision, shall give rise to such an adjustment. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions, in the event that, with respect to any such amendment, the Corporation receives either an unqualified opinion from a nationally recognized independent tax counsel selected by the Corporation or a private letter ruling or similar form of authorization from the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (&quot;IRS&quot;) to the effect that such an amendment does not apply to dividends payable on the Series B Preferred Stock, then any such amendment shall not result in the adjustment provided for pursuant to the DRD Formula. The opinion referenced in the previous sentence shall be based upon a specific exception in the legislation amending the DRP or upon a published pronouncement of the IRS addressing such legislation. Unless the context otherwise requires, references to dividends herein shall mean dividends as adjusted by the DRD Formula. The Corporation&#39;s calculation of the dividends payable as so adjusted, and as certified accurate as to calculation and reasonable as to method by the independent certified public accountants then regularly engaged by the Corporation, shall be final and not subject to review.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">If any amendment to the Code which reduces the Dividends Received Percentage is enacted after a Dividend Record Date and before the next Dividend Payment Date, the amount of dividend payable on such Dividend Payment Date shall not be increased; but instead, an amount equal to the excess of (x) the product of the dividends paid by the Corporation on such Dividend Payment Date and the DRD Formula (where the DRP used in the DRD Formula would be equal to the greater of the Dividends Received Percentage applicable to the dividend in question and .50) over (y) the dividends paid by the Corporation on such Dividend Payment Date, shall be payable (if declared) to holders of record on the next succeeding Dividend Payment Date in addition to any other amounts payable on such date.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">3</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In addition, if any such amendment to the Code is enacted that reduces the Dividends Received Percentage and such reduction retroactively applies to a Dividend Payment Date as to which the Corporation previously paid dividends on the Series B Preferred Stock (each an &quot;Affected Dividend Payment Date&quot;), the Corporation shall pay (if declared) additional dividends (the &quot;Additional Dividends&quot;) on the next succeeding Dividend Payment Date (or if such amendment is enacted after the dividend payable on such Dividend Payment Date has been declared, on the second succeeding Dividend Payment Date following the date of enactment) to holders of record on such succeeding Dividend Payment Date in an amount equal to the excess of (x) the product of the dividends paid by the Corporation on each Affected Dividend Payment Date and the DRD Formula (where the DRP used in the DRD Formula would be equal to the greater of the Dividends Received Percentage and .50 applied to each Affected Dividend Payment Date) over</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">(y) the dividends paid by the Corporation on each Affected Dividend Payment Date.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Notwithstanding the foregoing, Additional Dividends shall not be paid as a result of the enactment of any amendment to the Code 18 months or more after the date of original issuance of the Series B Preferred Stock which retroactively reduces the Dividends Received Percentage, or if such amendment would not result in an adjustment due to the Corporation having received either an opinion of counsel or tax ruling referred to in the third preceding paragraph.
