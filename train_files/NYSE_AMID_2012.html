Business Overview</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">We are a growth-oriented Delaware limited partnership that was formed by American Infrastructure MLP Fund, L.P. (“AIM”) in August 2009 to own, operate, develop and acquire a diversified portfolio of natural gas midstream energy assets. We are engaged in the business of gathering, treating, processing, fractionating and transporting natural gas through our ownership and operation of ten gathering systems, four processing facilities and a 50% non-operating interest in a fifth plant, two interstate pipelines and four intrastate pipelines. Our primary assets, which are strategically located in Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi, Tennessee and Texas, provide critical infrastructure that links producers and suppliers of natural gas to diverse natural gas markets, including various interstate and intrastate pipelines, as well as utility, industrial and other commercial customers. As of December 31, 2012, we operate approximately 1,400 miles of pipelines that gather and transport over 600 MMcf/d of natural gas.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Our operations are organized into two segments: (i) Gathering and Processing and (ii) Transmission. In our Gathering and Processing segment, we receive fee-based and fixed-margin compensation for gathering, transporting and treating natural gas. Where we provide processing services at the plants that we own or share an interest, or obtain processing services for our own account under our elective processing arrangements, we typically retain and sell a percentage of the residue natural gas and/or resulting NGLs under percent of proceeds (“POP”) arrangements. We own four processing facilities that collectively produced an average of approximately 49.9 Mgal/d and 54.5 Mgal/d of gross NGLs for years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011 , respectively.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Effective July 1, 2012, we acquired an 87.4% undivided interest in the Chatom system which processed 8.1 MMcf/d from eight connected wells to our account in 2012. Average NGL and condensate sales for the year ended December 31, 2012 were approximately 20.0 Mgal/d. Effective November 1, 2011, we acquired a 50% undivided non-operating interest in the Burns Point Plant which produced 9.6 Mgal/d to our account in 2012 . In addition, in connection with our elective processing arrangements, we contract for processing capacity at a third-party plant where we have the option to process natural gas that we purchase. Under these arrangements, we sold an average of approximately 27.9 Mgal/d and 27.4 Mgal/d of net equity NGL volumes for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011 , respectively. We also receive fee-based and fixed-margin compensation in our Transmission segment primarily related to capacity reservation charges under our firm transportation contracts and the transportation of natural gas pursuant to our interruptible transportation and fixed-margin contracts.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">For the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011 , we generated $50.6 million and $45.9 million of gross margin, respectively, of which $37.2 million and $32.1 million , respectively, was segment gross margin generated in our Gathering and Processing segment and $13.3 million and</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">$13.7 million , respectively, was segment gross margin generated in our Transmission segment. For the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011 , $24.5 million and $27.1 million, or 48.5% and 59.0% , respectively, of our gross margin was generated from fee-based, fixed-margin and firm and interruptible transportation contracts with respect to which we have little or no direct commodity price exposure. For a definition of gross margin and a reconciliation of gross margin to its most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP, please read “Selected Historical Financial and Operating Data — Non-GAAP Financial Measures.”</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">On April 15, 2013, the Partnership, our general partner and AIM Midstream Holdings, LLC, an affiliate of American Infrastructure MLP Fund, entered into agreements with High Point Infrastructure Partners, LLC, an affiliate of ArcLight Capital Partners, LLC (“High Point”), pursuant to which High Point (i) acquired 90% of our general partner and all of our subordinated units from AIM Midstream Holdings and (ii) contributed certain midstream assets and $15 million in cash to us in exchange for 5,142,857 convertible preferred units (the “Series A Preferred Units”) issued by the Partnership. As a result of these transactions, which were also consummated on April 15, 2013, High Point acquired both control of our general partner, which holds all of our general partner units and incentive distribution rights, and a majority of our outstanding limited partnership interests. The midstream assets contributed by High Point consist of approximately 700 miles of natural gas and liquids pipeline assets located in southeast Louisiana and the shallow water and deep shelf Gulf of Mexico. These midstream assets gather natural gas from both onshore and offshore producing regions around southeast Louisiana. The onshore footprint is Plaquemines and St. Bernard&#39;s Parish, LA. The offshore footprint consists of the following federal Gulf of Mexico zones: Mississippi Canyon, Viosca Knoll, West Delta, Main Pass, South Pass and Breton Sound. Natural gas is collected at more than 75 receipt points that connect to hundreds of wells targeting various geological zones in water depths up to 1,000 feet, with an emphasis on oil and liquids-rich reservoirs. The High Point midstream assets are comprised of FERC- regulated transmission assets and non-jurisdictional gathering assets, both of which accept natural gas from well production and interconnected pipeline systems. High Point delivers the natural gas to the Toca Gas Processing Plant, operated by Enterprise, where the products are processed and the residue gas sent to an unaffiliated interstate system owned by Kinder Morgan.

We expect to achieve this objective by executing the following strategies:</p></li><li style="padding-left: 37pt;text-indent: -18pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;"><h4 style="display: inline;">Capitalize on Organic Growth Opportunities Associated with Our Existing Assets. <span class="p">We continually seek to identify and evaluate</span></h4><p style="padding-left: 36pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">economically attractive organic expansion and asset enhancement opportunities that leverage our existing asset footprint and strategic</p><p style="padding-left: 36pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">relationships with our customers. We expect to have opportunities to expand our systems into new markets and sources of supply, which we believe will make our services more attractive to our customers. We intend to focus on projects that can be completed at a relatively low cost and have potential for attractive returns.</p></li><li style="padding-left: 37pt;text-indent: -18pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;"><h4 style="display: inline;">Attract Additional Volumes to Our Systems. <span class="p">We intend to attract new volumes of natural gas to our systems from existing and new</span></h4><p style="padding-left: 36pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">customers by continuing to provide superior customer service and aggressively marketing our services to additional customers in our</p><p style="padding-left: 36pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">areas of operation. In addition, we intend to rebuild or reestablish relationships with customers that were potentially under-served by the previous owner of our assets. For example, in 2010 we were able to contract with a customer on our Gloria system for volumes of natural gas that it had decided to have gathered and processed by alternative means prior to our acquisition of the system. We have available capacity on a majority of our systems, and as a result, we can accommodate additional volumes at a minimal incremental cost.</p></li><li style="padding-left: 37pt;text-indent: -18pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;"><h4 style="display: inline;">Pursue Strategic and Accretive Acquisitions. <span class="p">We plan to pursue accretive acquisitions of energy infrastructure assets that are</span></h4><p style="padding-left: 36pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">complementary to our existing asset base or that provide attractive returns in new operating regions or business lines. We will pursue</p><p style="padding-left: 36pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">acquisitions in our areas of operation that we believe will allow us to realize operational efficiencies by capitalizing on our existing infrastructure, personnel and customer relationships. We will also seek acquisitions in new geographic areas or new but related business lines to the extent that we believe we can utilize our operational expertise to enhance our business with these acquisitions. For example, in November 2011, we acquired from Marathon Oil Company a fifty percent (50%) non-operating working interest in the Burns Point Plant. The Burns Point Plant is located in St Mary Parish, LA and to which our Quivira Gathering system is connected. In July 2012, we acquired from affiliates of Quantum Resources Management, LLC., a 87.4% undivided interest in the Chatom system. The Chatom system is located in Alabama and is located 15 miles from our Bazor Ridge system.</p></li><li style="padding-left: 37pt;text-indent: -18pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;"><h4 style="display: inline;">Develop strategic and accretive new asset platforms. <span class="p">We plan selectively to pursue the development of new complementary midstream</span></h4><p style="padding-left: 36pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">asset platforms in our current operating regions and in new midstream assets that provide attractive returns in regions where we currently</p><p style="padding-left: 36pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">do not have any assets. We believe it is important to our current and potential customers that we act as their midstream partner beyond our current asset footprint, so it is important to have the ability to develop new infrastructure for our customers where they deem it necessary in an accretive and economically attractive manner. As our customers move to produce new areas or develop new end use markets, we seek to provide solutions for their midstream needs. We will develop assets in our current lines of business, but may pursue opportunities in new but related business lines as well.</p></li><li style="padding-left: 37pt;text-indent: -18pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;"><h4 style="display: inline;">Manage Exposure to Commodity Price Risk. <span class="p">We will manage our commodity price exposure by targeting a contract portfolio that is</span></h4><p style="padding-left: 36pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">weighted towards firm transportation, fee-based and fixed-margin contracts while mitigating direct commodity price exposure by</p><p style="padding-left: 36pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">employing a prudent hedging strategy. For the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011 , approximately 48.5% and 59.0% , respectively, of our gross margin was generated from firm transportation, fee-based and fixed-margin contracts that, together with our percent-of-proceeds contracts and hedging activities, generated relatively stable cash flows. As of December 31, 2012 , we have hedged approximately 55% of our expected 2013 net equity natural gas, NGL and condensate volumes with a combination of swaps, puts and collars for the specific commodity risk to which we are exposed. With respect to our exposure to natural gas prices, we are generally long natural gas on certain of our systems and short natural gas on certain of our other systems, which effectively creates a natural hedge against our exposure to fluctuations in the price of natural gas.</p></li><li style="padding-left: 37pt;text-indent: -18pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;"><h4 style="display: inline;">Maintain Financial Flexibility and Conservative Leverage <span class="p">. We plan to pursue a disciplined financial policy and seek to maintain a</span></h4><p style="padding-left: 36pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">conservative capital structure that we believe will allow us to consider attractive growth projects and acquisitions even in challenging</p><p style="padding-left: 36pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">commodity price or capital markets environments.</p></li><li style="padding-left: 37pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;"><h4 style="display: inline;">Continue our Commitment to Safe Environmentally Sound Operations. <span class="p">The safety of our employees and the communities in which we operate is one of our highest priorities. We believe it is critical to handle natural gas and NGLs for our customers safely, while striving to minimize the environmental impact of our operations. To this end, we implemented a safety performance program, including an integrity</span></h4><p style="padding-left: 36pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">management program, upon our formation in 2009 and implemented planned maintenance programs to increase the safety, reliability and efficiency of our operations.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s6" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Competitive Strengths</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">We believe that we will be able to successfully execute our business strategies because of the following competitive strengths:</p></li><li style="padding-left: 37pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;"><h4 style="display: inline;">Well Positioned to Pursue Opportunities Overlooked by Larger Competitors <span class="p">. Our size and flexibility, in conjunction with our geographically diverse asset base, positions us to pursue economically attractive growth projects and acquisitions that may not be large enough to be attractive to many of our larger competitors. Given the current size of our business, these opportunities may have a larger</span></h4><p style="padding-left: 36pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">impact on us than they would have on our competitors and may provide us with material</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">6</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="776" height="2" alt="image" src="NYSE_AMID_2012/Image_011.png"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 36pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">growth opportunities. In addition, as a result of our focus on customer service, we believe that we have unique insights into our customers’ needs and are well situated to take advantage of organic growth opportunities that arise from those needs. The benefits of our size and flexibility apply not only to the opportunities around our current assets but to opportunities to develop new asset platforms as well, where we can pursue the development of a new system that will be an impactful new asset to our company that would not be meaningful enough to gain the attention of our larger competitors.</p></li><li style="padding-left: 37pt;text-indent: -18pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;"><h4 style="display: inline;">Diversified Asset Base. <span class="p">Our assets are diversified geographically and by business line, which contributes to the stability of our cash</span></h4><p style="padding-left: 36pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">flows and creates a number of potential growth avenues for our business. We primarily operate in five states, have access to multiple</p><p style="padding-left: 36pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">sources of natural gas supply and service various interstate and intrastate pipelines as well as utility, industrial and other commercial customers. We believe this diversification provides us with a variety of growth opportunities and mitigates our exposure to reduced activity in any one area.</p></li><li style="padding-left: 37pt;text-indent: -18pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;"><h4 style="display: inline;">Strategically Located Assets. <span class="p">Our assets are located in areas where we believe there will be opportunities to access new natural gas</span></h4><p style="padding-left: 36pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">supplies and to capture new customers that are underserved by our competitors. We continue to see drilling activity on and around our</p><p style="padding-left: 36pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">systems, and we believe that our assets are strategically positioned to capitalize on the resurgent drilling activity, increased demand for midstream services and growing commodity consumption in the Gulf Coast and Southeast U.S. regions. This belief is based on:</p><ul id="l3"><li style="padding-left: 88pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">the proximity of our gathering and transmission systems to newly producing wells and the relatively lower cost to connect to our systems compared to those farther away;</p></li><li style="padding-left: 88pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">the available capacity of our systems, coupled with an ability to add capacity economically to our systems; and</p></li><li style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 88pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">many of our systems have multiple downstream interconnects that provide our customers with multiple market delivery options, thus causing our systems to be more attractive versus those of our competitors.</p></li></ul></li><li style="padding-left: 36pt;text-indent: -18pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;"><h4 style="display: inline;">Focus on Delivering Excellent Customer Service. <span class="p">We view our strong customer relationships as one of our key assets and believe it is</span></h4><p style="padding-left: 36pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">critical to maintain operational excellence and ensure best-in-class customer service and reliability. Furthermore, we believe our</p><p style="padding-left: 36pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">entrepreneurial culture and smaller size relative to our peers enables us to offer more customized and creative solutions for our customers and to be more responsive to their needs.

In addition, our field supervisory team has operated our assets for an average of more than 20 years. We believe that our field employees’ knowledge of the assets will further contribute to our ability to execute our business strategies.

In addition, we own a 50% non-operating interest in the Burns Point Plant and have the right to contract for processing services for our own account at a plant that is connected to our Gloria system, the Toca plant. The Toca plant is owned and operated by Enterprise Products Partners, LP (“Enterprise”) which also operates the Burns Point Plant. Our Bazor Ridge processing plant, the Chatom processing plant, the Burns Point plant and the Toca plant are all cryogenic processing plants. These types of processing plants represent the latest generation of processing techniques, using extremely low temperatures and high pressures to optimize the extraction of NGLs from the raw natural gas stream.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">We generally derive revenue in our Gathering and Processing segment from fee-based, fixed-margin and POP arrangements, whether for our producer and supplier customers or our own account. We have no keep-whole arrangements with our customers. On our Gloria, Lafitte and Offshore Texas systems and other, we purchase natural gas from producers or suppliers at receipt points on our systems at an index price less a fixed transportation fee and subsequently transport that natural gas to delivery points on our systems at which we sell the natural gas at the same undiscounted index price thereby earning a fixed margin on each transaction. We regard the segment gross margin we earn with respect to those purchases and sales a “fixed-margin” and as the economic equivalent of a fee for our transportation service, and as such, we include these transactions in the category of fee-based contractual arrangements. In order to minimize commodity price risk we face in these transactions, we match sales with purchases at the index price on the date of settlement. For the year ended December 31, 2012 , our fee-based and fixed-margin arrangements and our POP arrangements accounted for approximately 30.2% and 69.8%, respectively, of our segment gross margin for this segment. For the year ended December 31, 2011 , our fee-based and fixed-margin arrangements and our POP arrangements accounted for approximately 41.2% and 58.8%, respectively, of our segment gross margin for this segment.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">We continually seek new sources of raw natural gas supply to maintain and increase the throughput volume on our gathering systems and through our processing plants. As a result, we connected ten new supply sources in 2012 to systems in our Gathering and Processing segment, including connections of individual wells, as well as central delivery points.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Our Gathering and Processing assets are located in Alabama, Louisiana and Mississippi and in shallow state and federal waters in the Gulf of Mexico off the coasts of Louisiana and Texas.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Gloria System</h4><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The Gloria gathering system provides gathering and compression services through our assets, as well as processing services through our elective processing arrangements. The Gloria system is located in Lafourche, Jefferson, Plaquemines, St. Charles and St. Bernard parishes of Louisiana and consists of approximately 110 miles of pipeline with diameters ranging from three to 16 inches and three compressors with a combined size of 1,877 horsepower. The Gloria system has a design capacity of approximately 90 MMcf/d, but is currently limited by compression horsepower at the Gloria Compressor Station to approximately 60 MMcf/d. Average throughput on the Gloria system for the year ended December 31, 2012 was 38.3 MMcf/d from approximately 62 connected wells and an interconnect with our Lafitte system. Average throughput on the Gloria system increased to approximately 43.3 MMcf/d from 59 connected wells for the year ended December 31, 2011 due to excess volumes from our Lafitte system, primarily resulting from incremental volumes from the interconnect between the Lafitte system and Tennessee Gas Pipeline Company, LLC (&quot;TGP&quot;), an interstate pipeline owned by Kinder Morgan as a result of line looping, interconnection and compression projects completed in 2012. For more information about the excess natural gas from our Lafitte system, please read “— Lafitte System.”</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The Gloria system gathers natural gas from onshore oil and natural gas wells producing from the Gulf Coast region of Louisiana. Production is derived from a variety of reservoirs and ranges from dry natural gas to rich associated natural gas. Well decline rates are variable in this area, but it is common practice for producers to mitigate declines in production with workovers and re-completions of existing wells. An average of two- three wells per year were connected to the Gloria system over the last  three years, with three wells  connected during the year ended December 31, 2012. Producers generally bear the cost of connecting their wells to our Gloria system.</p><p class="s25" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Toca Plant and Our Elective Processing Arrangements. <span class="p">The Toca plant is a cryogenic processing plant with a design capacity of approximately</span></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">1.1 Bcf/d that is located in St. Bernard Parish in Louisiana and operated by Enterprise. We entered into a new POP processing contract with Enterprise in July 2011 that replaced two month-to-month POP processing contracts with Enterprise and allows us to continue to process raw natural gas through the Toca plant, whether for our customers or our own account. This new contract has an initial term of seven years and covers volumes from both our Gloria and Lafitte systems. The new contract contains a tiered-pricing structure based on the volume of natural gas processed under which Enterprise retains a percentage of the NGLs</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">9</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 2pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="776" height="2" alt="image" src="NYSE_AMID_2012/Image_021.png"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">produced by the Toca plant as payment for its processing services. Natural gas that is processed at the Toca plant is transported to end users via the Sonat pipeline directly and through various interconnects downstream of the Toca plant. Sonat is the primary pipeline into which Toca volumes are currently delivered. Sonat has sold its Gulf of Mexico gathering facilities located upstream of the Toca Plant to High Point Gas Transmission, LLC.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Our month-to-month contracts with producers on the Gloria and Lafitte systems, as well as our ability to purchase natural gas at the Lafitte/TGP interconnect, provide us with the flexibility to decide whether to process natural gas through the Toca plant and capture processing margins for our own account or deliver the natural gas into the interstate pipeline market at the inlet to the Toca plant, and we make this decision based on the relative prices of natural gas and NGLs on a monthly basis. We refer to the flexibility built into these contracts as our elective processing arrangements. Due to currently strong processing margins, we currently process 100% of the natural gas purchased on the Gloria system, as well as any excess natural gas purchased via the Lafitte/TGP interconnect in excess of the needs of ConocoPhillips at the Alliance Refinery. Based on publicly available information, we believe that the Toca plant has sufficient capacity available to accommodate additional volumes from the Gloria system.</p><h4 style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Chatom System</h4><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Effective July 1, 2012, we acquired an 87.4% undivided interest in the Chatom system from affiliates of Quantum Resources Management, LLC. The acquisition fair value consideration of $51.4 million includes a credit associated with the cash flow the Chatom system generated between January 1, 2012, and the effective date of July 1, 2012. The consideration paid by the Partnership consisted of cash, which was funded by borrowings under our June 2012 amended credit facility.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The Chatom system consists of a 25 MMcf/d refrigeration processing plant, a 1,100 Bbl/d fractionation unit, a 160 long-ton per day sulfur recovery unit, and a 29 mile gas gathering system. The system is located in Washington County, Alabama, approximately 15 miles from our Bazor Ridge processing plant in Wayne County, Mississippi. The Chatom system gathers natural gas from onshore oil and natural gas wells producing in Alabama and Mississippi.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">We have POP arrangements with each of the customers operating these wells. After processing, the residue natural gas is sold and delivered to Clarke Mobile, a local distribution company in Alabama, at a Florida Gas Transmission Zone 3 index-based price. The NGLs are fractionated at the Chatom system and then sold at the tailgate of the plant to various counterparties at a Mt. Belvieu index-based price. Condensate in the inlet natural gas stream is separated at the plant and sold at the tailgate to Shell Trading (US) Company at a Louisiana Light Sweet index-based price. Sulfur is recovered from the inlet natural gas stream and sold to a local sulfur consumer at a Tampa index-based price.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Additionally, the Chatom system fractionates NGLs from a third party supplier under a long-term fractionation agreement. The contract consists of a fee-based component as well as an arrangement to purchase and resell the fractionated NGLs at indexed pricing.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Average natural gas throughput on the Chatom system for the year ended December 31, 2012 was approximately 8.1 MMcf/d from eight connected wells. Average NGL and condensate sales for the year ended December 31, 2012 were approximately 20.0 Mgal/d.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Lafitte System</h4><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The Lafitte gathering system consists of approximately 41 miles of gathering pipeline, with diameters ranging from four to 12 inches and a design capacity of approximately 71 MMcf/d. The Lafitte system originates onshore in southern Louisiana and terminates in Plaquemines Parish, Louisiana at the Alliance Refinery owned by ConocoPhillips Corporation, or ConocoPhillips. Average throughput on the Lafitte system for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011 was 22.6 MMcf/d and 19.3 MMcf/d, respectively, from approximately 46 connected wells and an interconnect with TGP that was completed in December 2010. We are the sole supplier of natural gas to the Alliance Refinery through our Lafitte and Gloria systems. We supply natural gas to the Alliance Refinery pursuant to a long-term contract that expires in 2023. Any natural gas not used by ConocoPhillips at the Alliance Refinery is delivered to our Gloria system.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Like our nearby Gloria system, the Lafitte system gathers natural gas from onshore oil and natural gas wells producing from the Gulf Coast region of Louisiana. An average of one well per year was connected to the Lafitte system over the last three years, with two wells connected during the year ended December 31, 2012 . Producers generally bear the cost of connecting their wells to our Lafitte system.</p><p class="s25" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">TGP Interconnect. <span class="p">In December 2010, we completed an interconnect between our Lafitte pipeline and the TGP interstate system. This interconnect provides a redundant source of natural gas supply for the ConocoPhillips Alliance Refinery to the extent that the Lafitte native production is insufficient to supply the needs of the refinery and provides us with increased operational flexibility on our Gloria and Lafitte systems. To the extent that there is excess supply that the refinery does not consume, we purchase those</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">10</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 2pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="776" height="2" alt="image" src="NYSE_AMID_2012/Image_022.png"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">volumes to be sold into Sonat pursuant to a fixed-margin arrangement or to be processed at the Toca processing facility pursuant to elective processing arrangements.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Bazor Ridge System</h4><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The Bazor Ridge gathering and processing system consists of approximately 160 miles of pipeline with diameters ranging from three to eight inches and three compressor stations with a combined compression capacity of 1,069 horsepower. Our Bazor Ridge system is located in Jasper, Clarke, Wayne and Greene Counties of Mississippi. The Bazor Ridge system also contains a sour natural gas treating and cryogenic processing plant located in Wayne County, Mississippi with a design capacity of approximately 22 MMcf/d and four inlet and one discharge compressor with approximately 5,218 of combined horsepower. We upgraded the turbo expander at the Bazor Ridge processing plant in June 2010, which resulted in a significant  improvement in the plant’s NGL recoveries  and provided us  with greater operating flexibility during changing commodity price environments. We have POP arrangements with each of our customers on the Bazor Ridge system that generally include a fee- based element for gathering and treating services. After processing, the residue natural gas is sold and delivered into the Destin Pipeline system, an interstate pipeline operated by Destin Pipeline Company, L.L.C., which has connections with a number of other interstate pipeline systems. We sell the NGLs we recover at the truck rack at the tailgate of the Bazor Ridge processing plant to Dufour Petroleum LP, an affiliate of Enbridge, pursuant to a month-to-month contract or transport them to our Chatom system for fractionation and sale. The NGLs are sold on a Mt. Belvieu index-based price. Average throughput on the Bazor Ridge plant for the year ended December 31, 2012 was approximately</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">12.6 MMcf/d from 46 connected wells. Average throughput increased from the prior year and was approximately 13.4 MMcf/d for the year ended December 31, 2011 as a result of the completion of the Winchester lateral, which we describe below, in November 2010.</p><p class="s25" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Winchester Lateral. <span class="p">In 2010, we built a new eight-inch diameter pipeline consisting of approximately nine miles of pipe, called the Winchester lateral, to serve the natural gas wells located in Wayne County, Mississippi owned by Venture Oil &amp; Gas, Inc., (“Venture”), and other producers. The Winchester lateral allowed us to increase the effective throughput capacity of the Bazor Ridge gathering system by approximately 200% to approximately 25 MMcf/d. In conjunction with the construction of the Winchester lateral, we negotiated a five-year acreage dedication from Venture.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The natural gas supply for our Bazor Ridge system is derived primarily from rich associated natural gas produced from oil wells targeting the mature Upper Smackover formation. Production from the wells drilled in this area is generally stable with relatively modest decline rates. An average of one to two wells per year was connected to our Bazor Ridge gathering system over the last three years, with 4 wells connected during the year ended December 31, 2012 . Despite the low number of new wells connected, the generally stable production and relatively modest decline rates from this formation allow us to maintain steady throughput on our Bazor Ridge system. Given the recent and current commodity price environment for crude oil, we expect continued increases in drilling activity and resulting production in this area during 2013.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Quivira System</h4><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The Quivira gathering system consists of approximately 34 miles of pipeline, with a 12-inch diameter mainline and several laterals ranging in diameter from six to eight inches. The system originates offshore of Iberia and St. Mary Parishes of Louisiana in Eugene Island Block 24 and terminates onshore in St. Mary Parish, Louisiana at a connection with the Burns Point Plant, a cryogenic processing plant with a design capacity of 165 MMcf/d that is jointly owned by us and the plant operator, Enterprise. The Quivira system has a design capacity of approximately 140 MMcf/d. This system also includes an onshore condensate handling facility at Bayou Sale, Louisiana that is upstream of the Burns Point Plant. Residue natural gas is sold into TGP, SONAT or the Gulf South Pipeline system, an interstate pipeline owned by Boardwalk Pipeline Partners, LP.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The Quivira system is partially subscribed under a firm transportation arrangement through 2014, although a substantial proportion of the revenue is derived from volumetric and fee-based charges. Existing production in our gathering area above our current system capacity is transported on other systems that we believe offer producers less attractive economic alternatives to our customers. Average throughput on the Quivira system for the year ended December 31, 2011 was approximately 110.8 MMcf/d from 16 connected wells. Average throughput decreased to approximately 79.1 MMcf/d for the year ended December 31, 2012 as a result of production shut-ins and changes to production profiles associated with an interconnect to a gathering system owned and operated by a certain producer.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The Quivira system provides gathering services for natural gas wells and associated natural gas produced from crude oil wells operated by major and independent producers targeting multiple conventional production zones in the shallow waters of the Gulf of Mexico. Wells in this area have historically exhibited relatively low rates of decline throughout the life of the wells. The natural gas produced from these wells is typically natural gas with condensate. An average of two wells per year were connected to the Quivira system over the last three years. No wells were connected during the year ended December 31, 2012 . Producers generally bear the cost of connecting their wells to our Quivira system.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">11</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="776" height="2" alt="image" src="NYSE_AMID_2012/Image_023.png"/></span></p><h4 style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Burns Point Plant</h4><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Effective November 1, 2011, we acquired a 50% undivided interest in the Burns Point Plant from Marathon Oil Company. The remaining 50% undivided interest is owned by the plant operator, Enterprise. The plant, which is an unincorporated venture, is governed by a construction and operating agreement.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The plant is located in St. Mary Parish, Louisiana, and processes raw natural gas using a cryogenic expander. The plant inlet volumes are sourced from offshore natural gas production via our Quivira system, Gulf South pipelines and onshore from individual producers near the plant. Our Quivira system supplied up to approximately 85% of the inlet volume to the plant during 2012. The residue gas is transported, via pipeline to Gulf South, SONAT and Tennessee Gas Pipeline and the Y-grade liquid is transported via pipeline to K/D/S Promix, LLC (“Promix”), an Enterprise operated fractionator. The Burns Point plant is designed to process up to 200 MMcf/d but is currently limited to 165 MMcf/d due to compression constraints. The acquisition complemented our existing assets given the location of the Plant in comparison to the Quivira system.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">In 2012, the average throughput at Burns Point was 98.2 MMcf/d and the average NGLs for our account was 9.6 Mgal/d.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The plant is not a legal entity but rather an asset that is jointly owned by Enterprise and us. We acquired an interest in the asset group and do not hold an interest in a legal entity. Each of the owners in the asset group is proportionately liable for the liabilities. Outside of the rights and responsibilities of the operator, we and Enterprise have equal rights and obligations to the assets. Significant non-capital and maintenance capital expenditures, plant expansions and significant plant dispositions require the approval of both owners.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Offshore Texas System</h4><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The Offshore Texas system consists of the GIGS and Brazos systems, two parallel gathering systems that share common geography and operating characteristics. The Offshore Texas system provides gathering and dehydration services to natural gas producers in the shallow waters of the Gulf of Mexico region offshore Texas.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The Offshore Texas system consists of approximately 56 miles of pipeline with diameters ranging from six to 16 inches and a design capacity of approximately 100 MMcf/d. Additionally, the Offshore Texas system has two onshore separation and dehydration units, each with a capacity of approximately 40 MMcf/d, that remove water and other impurities from the gathered natural gas before delivering it to our customers. The GIGS system originates offshore of Brazoria County, Texas in Galveston Island Block 343 and connects onshore to the Houston Pipeline system, an intrastate pipeline owned by Energy Transfer Partners, L.P. The Brazos system originates offshore of Brazoria County, Texas in Brazos Block 366 and connects onshore to the Dow Pipeline system, an intrastate pipeline owned by Dow Chemical Company. Substantially all of the natural gas gathered on the Brazos system is delivered to Dow Chemical for use in its chemical plant located in Freeport, Texas pursuant to a month-to-month contract. Dow consumes significantly more natural gas than is provided by the Brazos system and we believe Dow may purchase additional volumes from the Brazos system.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Average throughput on the Offshore Texas system for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011 was 15.2 MMcf/d and 18.2 MMcf/d, respectively from approximately 22 connected wells.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">All of the wells in this area are natural gas wells producing from the Gulf of Mexico shelf offshore Texas. An average of two wells per year were connected to the Offshore Texas system over the last three years. No wells were connected during the year ended December 31, 2012 . Producers generally bear the cost of connecting their wells to our Texas Offshore system.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Other Gathering and Processing Assets</h4><p class="s25" style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Alabama Processing. <span class="p">The Alabama Processing system consists of two small skid-mounted treating and processing plants that we refer to, individually, as Atmore and Wildfork.

intrastate natural gas pipeline that travels west to east from an interconnection point with TGP in Colbert County, Alabama to two power plants owned by Calpine Corporation, or Calpine, in Morgan County, Alabama. The Bamagas system consists of 52 miles of high pressure, 30-inch pipeline with a design capacity of approximately 450 MMcf/d.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Average throughput on the Bamagas system for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011 was approximately 151.3 MMcf/d and</p><ol id="l9"><ol id="l10"><li style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><p style="display: inline;">MMcf/d, respectively. Currently, 100% of the throughput on this system is contracted under long-term firm transportation agreements. Calpine Corporation is the sole customer on the Bamagas system, with two firm transportation contracts providing for a total of 200 MMcf/d of firm transportation capacity. These contracts, which expire in 2020, ensure steady natural gas supply for the Morgan and Decatur Energy Centers in Morgan County, Alabama. These two natural gas-fired power plants were built in 2002 and 2003 and have a combined capacity of 1,502 megawatts. These generating facilities supply the Tennessee Valley Authority (“TVA”), with electricity under long-term contractual arrangements between Calpine Corporation and the TVA.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">AlaTenn System</h4><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The AlaTenn system is an interstate natural gas pipeline that interconnects with TGP and travels west to east delivering natural gas to industrial customers in northwestern Alabama, as well as the city gates of Decatur and Huntsville, Alabama. Our AlaTenn system has a design capacity of approximately 200 MMcf/d and is comprised of approximately 295 miles of pipeline with diameters ranging from three to 16 inches and includes two compressor stations with combined capacity of 3,665 horsepower. The AlaTenn system is connected to four receipt and approximately 61 delivery points, including the Tetco Pipeline system, an interstate pipeline owned by Spectra Energy Transmission, LLC, and the Columbia Gulf Pipeline system, an interstate pipeline owned by NiSource Gas Transmission and Storage. Average throughput on the AlaTenn system for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011 was approximately 46.1 MMcf/d and 46.0 MMcf/d, respectively.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Midla System</h4><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Our Midla system is an interstate natural gas pipeline with approximately 370 miles of pipeline linking the Monroe Natural Gas Field in Northern Louisiana and interconnections with the Transco Pipeline system and Gulf South Pipeline system to customers near Baton Rouge, Louisiana. Our Midla system also has interconnects to Centerpoint, TGP and Sonat along a high-pressure lateral at the north end of the system, called the T-32 lateral.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Our Midla system is strategically located near the Perryville Hub, which is a major hub for natural gas produced in the Louisiana and broader Gulf Coast region, including natural gas from the Haynesville shale, Barnett shale, Fayetteville shale, Woodford shale and Deep Bossier formations of Northern Louisiana, Central Texas, Northern Arkansas, Eastern Oklahoma and East Texas, respectively. The Midla system is connected to nine receipt and 19 delivery points. Due to the numerous interstate pipeline connections and growing supply and demand dynamics in the surrounding regions, we believe that our location near the Perryville Hub provides us a strategic advantage in securing supplies of natural gas.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Natural gas flows from north to south on the Midla mainline from interconnections with other interstate pipelines to customers and end users.

Natural gas on the northern end of the Midla system is delivered to two power plants operated by Entergy by way of the T-32 lateral and the CLECO Sterlington plant by way of the Sterlington lateral. These power plants are peak-load generating facilities that consumed an aggregate average of approximately 33.4 MMcf/d and 26.8 MMcf/d of natural gas for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. The T- 32 lateral is fully subscribed, with approximately 296 MMcf/d of firm transportation capacity under contracts that automatically renew on a year- to-year basis.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The mainline has a design capacity of approximately 198 MMcf/d and consists of approximately 172 miles of low pressure, 22-inch diameter pipeline with laterals ranging in diameter from two to 16 inches. This section of the Midla system primarily serves small LDCs under firm transportation contracts that automatically renew on a year-to-year basis. Substantially all of these contracts are at the maximum rates allowed under Midla’s FERC tariff. Average throughput on the Midla mainline for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011 was approximately</p><ol id="l12"><ol id="l13"><li style="padding-left: 27pt;text-indent: -20pt;text-align: justify;"><p style="display: inline;">MMcf/d and 44.6 MMcf/d, respectively.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The southern portion of the system, including interconnections with the MLGT system and other associated laterals, consists of approximately two miles of high and low pressure, 12-inch diameter pipeline. This section of the system primarily serves industrial and LDC customers in the Baton Rouge market through contracts with several large marketing companies. In addition, this section includes two small offshore gathering lines, the T-33 lateral in Grand Bay and the T-51 lateral in Eugene Island 28, each of which are approximately five miles in length. Natural gas delivered on the southern end of the system is sold under both firm and interruptible transportation contracts with average remaining terms of two years.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">MLGT System</h4><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The MLGT system is an intrastate transmission system that sources natural gas from interconnects with the FGT Pipeline system, the Tetco Pipeline system, the Transco Pipeline system and our Midla system to a Baton Rouge, Louisiana refinery owned and operated by ExxonMobil and several other industrial customers. Our MLGT system has a design capacity of approximately 170 MMcf/d and is comprised of approximately 54 miles of pipeline with diameters ranging from three to 14 inches. The MLGT system is connected to seven receipt and 17 delivery points. Average throughput on the MLGT system for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011 was approximately 44.5 MMcf/d and 51.9 MMcf/d, respectively.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Other Systems</h4><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Our other transmission systems include the Chalmette system, located in St. Bernard Parish, Louisiana, and the Trigas system, located in three counties in northwestern Alabama. The approximate design capacities for the Chalmette and Trigas systems are 125 MMcf/d and 60 MMcf/d, respectively. The approximate average throughput for these systems was 9.8 MMcf/d and 10.6 MMcf/d, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2012 and 10.6 MMcf/d and 13.0 MMcf/d, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2011.

Among all of our customers in this segment, the weighted-average remaining life of our firm and interruptible transportation contracts are approximately five years and less than one year, respectively. ExxonMobil, Enbridge Marketing (US) L.P., and Calpine Corporation are the three largest purchasers of natural gas and transmission capacity, respectively, in our Transmission segment and accounted for approximately 50% , 22% and 10% , respectively, of our segment revenue for the year ended December 31, 2012 and approximately 57% , 22% and 8% , respectively, of our segment revenue for the year ended December 31, 2011.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s6" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Competition</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The natural  gas  gathering, compression, treating and transportation business  is  very competitive. Our competitors  in our Gathering and Processing segment include other midstream companies, producers, intrastate and interstate pipelines. Competition for natural gas volumes is primarily based on reputation, commercial terms, reliability, service levels, location, available capacity, capital expenditures and fuel efficiencies. Our major competitors in this segment include TGP, Gulf South and ANR.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">In our Transmission segment, we compete with other pipelines that service regional markets, specifically in our Baton Rouge market. An increase in competition could result from new pipeline installations or expansions by existing pipelines. Competitive factors include the commercial terms, available capacity, fuel efficiencies, the interconnected pipelines and gas quality issues. Our major competitors for this segment are Southern Natural Gas Company and Louisiana Intrastate Gas.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s6" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Safety and Maintenance</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">We are subject to regulation by the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (“PHMSA”) pursuant to the Natural Gas Pipeline Safety Act of 1968 (“NGPSA”), and the Pipeline Safety Improvement Act of 2002, (“PSIA”), which was recently reauthorized and amended by the Pipeline Inspection, Protection, Enforcement and Safety Act of 2006. The NGPSA regulates safety requirements in the design, construction, operation and maintenance of gas pipeline facilities, while the PSIA establishes mandatory inspections for all U.S. oil and natural gas transportation pipelines and some gathering lines in high-consequence areas. The PHMSA has developed regulations implementing the PSIA that require transportation pipeline operators to implement integrity management programs, including more frequent inspections and other measures to ensure pipeline safety in “high consequence areas,” such as high population areas. The Pipeline Safety, Regulatory Certainty, and Job Creation Act of 2011, which became law in January 2012, increases the penalties for safety violations, establishes additional safety requirements for newly constructed pipelines and requires studies of safety issues that could result in the adoption of new regulatory requirements for existing pipelines. The PHMSA issued a final rule applying safety regulations to certain rural low-stress hazardous liquid pipelines that were not covered previously by some of its safety regulations. We believe that this rule does not apply to any of our pipelines. While we cannot predict the outcome of these legislative or regulatory initiatives, such legislative and regulatory changes could have a material effect on our operations, particularly by extending thorough more stringent and comprehensive safety regulations (such as integrity management requirements) to pipelines not previously subject to such requirements. While we expect any legislative or regulatory changes to allow us time to become compliant with new requirements, costs associated with compliance may have a material effect on our operations. We cannot predict with any certainty at this time the terms of any new laws or rules or the costs of compliance associated with such requirements.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">We regularly inspect our pipelines and third parties assist us in interpreting the results of the inspections.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">States are largely preempted by federal law from regulating pipeline safety for interstate lines but most are certified by the US Department of Transportation (“DOT”) to assume responsibility for enforcing federal intrastate pipeline regulations and inspection of intrastate pipelines. In practice, because states can adopt stricter standards for intrastate pipelines than those imposed by the federal government for interstate lines, states vary considerably in their authority and capacity to address pipeline safety. These state oil and gas standards may include requirements for facility design and management in addition to requirements for pipelines. We do not anticipate any significant difficulty in complying with applicable state laws and regulations. Our natural gas pipelines have continuous inspection and compliance programs designed to keep the facilities in compliance with pipeline safety and pollution control requirements.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">In addition, we are subject to a number of federal and state laws and regulations, including the federal Occupational Safety and Health Act, or OSHA, and comparable state statutes, the purposes of which are to protect the health and safety of workers, both generally and within the pipeline industry. In addition, the OSHA hazard communication standard, the Environmental Protection Agency, or EPA, community right-to- know regulations under Title III of the federal Superfund Amendment and Reauthorization Act and comparable state statutes require that information be maintained concerning hazardous materials used or produced in our operations and that such information be provided to employees, state and local government authorities and citizens.

Under the NGA, FERC has authority to regulate natural gas companies that provide natural gas pipeline transportation services in interstate commerce. Federal regulation of our interstate pipelines extends to such matters as:</p></li><li style="padding-left: 37pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">rates, services, and terms and conditions of service;</p></li><li style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 37pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">the types of services offered to customers;</p></li><li style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 37pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">the certification and construction of new facilities;</p></li><li style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 37pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">the acquisition, extension, disposition or abandonment of facilities;</p></li><li style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 37pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">the maintenance of accounts and records;</p></li><li style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 37pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">relationships between affiliated companies involved in certain aspects of the natural gas business;</p></li><li style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 37pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">the initiation and discontinuation of services;</p></li><li style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 37pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">market manipulation in connection with interstate sales, purchases or transportation of natural gas and NGLs; and</p></li><li style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 37pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">participation by interstate pipelines in cash management arrangements.</p></li></ul><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Under the NGA, the rates for service on these interstate facilities must be just and reasonable and not unduly discriminatory.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The rates and terms and conditions for our interstate pipeline services are set forth in FERC-approved tariffs. Pursuant to FERC’s jurisdiction over rates, existing rates may be challenged by complaint and proposed rate increases may be challenged by protest. Any successful complaint or protest against our rates could have an adverse impact on our revenue associated with providing transportation service.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">In 2008, FERC issued Order No. 717, a final rule that implements standards of conduct that include three primary rules: (1) the “independent functioning rule,” which requires transmission function and marketing function employees to operate independently of each other; (2) the “no- conduit rule,” which prohibits passing transmission function information to marketing function employees; and (3) the “transparency rule,” which imposes posting requirements to help detect any instances of undue preference. The FERC has since issued four rehearing orders which generally reaffirmed the determinations in Order No. 717 and also clarified certain provisions of the Standards of Conduct.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">In 2005, the FERC issued a policy statement permitting the inclusion of an income tax allowance in the cost of service-based rates of a pipeline organized as a tax pass through partnership entity to reflect actual or potential income tax liability on public utility income, if the pipeline proves that the ultimate owner of its interests has an actual or potential income tax liability on such income. The policy statement provided that whether a pipeline’s owners have such actual or potential income tax liability will be reviewed by the FERC on a case-by-case basis. In August 2005, FERC dismissed requests for rehearing of its new policy statement. In December 2005, the FERC issued its first significant case-specific review of the income tax allowance issue in another pipeline partnership’s rate case. The FERC reaffirmed its income tax allowance policy and directed the subject pipeline to provide certain evidence necessary for the pipeline to determine its income tax allowance. The tax allowance policy and the December 2005 order were appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, or D.C. Circuit. The D.C. Circuit denied these appeals in May 2007 in <i>ExxonMobil Oil Corporation v. FERC </i>and fully upheld the FERC’s tax allowance policy and the application of that policy in the December 2005 order. In 2007, the D.C. Circuit denied rehearing of its <i>ExxonMobil </i>decision. The <i>ExxonMobil </i>decision, its applicability, other orders issued by the FERC upholding the FERC&#39;s income tax allowance policy and the issue of the inclusion of an income tax allowance have been the subject of extensive litigation before the FERC. The FERC&#39;s most recent order upholding the policy was issued in September 2012. Several parties have appealed this FERC order. Whether a pipeline’s owners have actual or potential income tax liability continues to be reviewed by FERC on a case-by-case basis.

The FERC denied rehearing and no petitions for review of the Policy Statement were filed. In the policy statement, FERC concluded, among other matters that MLPs should be included in the proxy group used to determine return on equity for both oil and natural gas pipelines, but the long-term growth component of the DCF model should be limited to fifty percent of long-term gross domestic product. The adjustment to the long-term growth component, and all other things being equal, results in lower returns on equity than would be calculated without the adjustment. However, the actual return on equity for our interstate pipelines will depend on the specific companies included in the proxy group and the specific conditions at the time of the future rate case proceeding. FERC’s policy determinations applicable to MLPs are subject to further modification.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Section 311 Pipelines</h4><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Intrastate transportation of natural gas is largely regulated by the state in which such transportation takes place. To the extent that our intrastate natural gas transportation systems transport natural gas in interstate commerce without an exemption under the NGA, the rates, terms and conditions of such services are subject to FERC jurisdiction under Section 311 of the Natural Gas Policy Act, or NGPA, and Part 284 of the FERC’s regulations. Pipelines providing transportation service under Section 311 are required to provide services on an open and nondiscriminatory basis. The NGPA regulates, among other things, the provision of transportation services by an intrastate natural gas pipeline on behalf of a local distribution company or an interstate natural gas pipeline. The rates, terms and conditions of some transportation services provided on our Section 311 pipeline systems are subject to FERC regulation pursuant to Section 311 of the NGPA. Under Section 311, rates charged for intrastate transportation must be fair and equitable, and amounts collected in excess of fair and equitable rates are subject to refund with interest. The terms and conditions of service set forth in the intrastate facility’s statement of operating conditions are also subject to the FERC review and approval. Should the FERC determine not to authorize rates equal to or greater than our currently approved Section 311 rates, our business may be adversely affected. Failure to observe the service limitations applicable to transportation and storage services under Section 311, failure to comply with the rates approved by the FERC for Section 311 service, and failure to comply with the terms and conditions of service established in the pipeline’s FERC-approved statement of operating conditions could result in alteration of jurisdictional status, and/or the imposition of administrative, civil and criminal remedies.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Hinshaw Pipelines</h4><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Intrastate natural gas pipelines are defined as pipelines that operate entirely within a single state, and generally are not subject to FERC’s jurisdiction under the NGA. Hinshaw pipelines, by definition, also operate within a single state, but can receive gas from outside their state without becoming subject to FERC’s NGA jurisdiction. Specifically, Section 1(c) of the NGA exempts from the FERC’s NGA jurisdiction those pipelines which transport gas in interstate commerce if (1) they receive natural gas at or within the boundary of a state, (2) all the gas is consumed within that state and (3) the pipeline is regulated by a state commission. Following the enactment of the NGPA, the FERC issued Order No. 63 authorizing Hinshaw pipelines to apply for authorization to transport natural gas in interstate commerce in the same manner as intrastate pipelines operating pursuant to Section 311 of the NGPA. Hinshaw pipelines frequently operate pursuant to blanket certificates to provide transportation and sales service under the FERC’s regulations.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Historically, FERC did not require intrastate and Hinshaw pipelines to meet the same rigorous transactional reporting guidelines as interstate pipelines. However, as discussed below, in 2010 the FERC issued a new rule, Order No. 735, which increases FERC regulation of certain intrastate and Hinshaw pipelines. See “— Market Behavior Rules; Posting and Reporting Requirements.”</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Gathering Pipeline Regulation</h4><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Section 1(b) of the NGA exempts natural gas gathering facilities from the jurisdiction of FERC. However, some of our natural gas gathering activity is subject to Internet posting requirements imposed by FERC as a result of FERC’s market transparency initiatives. We believe that our natural gas pipelines meet the traditional tests that FERC has used to determine that a pipeline is a gathering pipeline and is, therefore, not subject to FERC jurisdiction. The distinction between FERC-regulated transmission services and federally unregulated gathering services, however, is the subject of substantial, on-going litigation, so the classification and regulation of our gathering facilities are subject to change based on future determinations by FERC, the courts or Congress. State regulation of gathering facilities generally includes various safety, environmental and, in some circumstances, nondiscriminatory take requirements and complaint-based rate regulation. In recent years, FERC has taken a more light-handed approach to regulation of the gathering activities of interstate pipeline transmission companies, which has resulted in a number of such companies transferring gathering facilities to unregulated affiliates. As a result of these activities, natural gas gathering may begin to receive greater regulatory scrutiny at both the state and federal levels. Our natural gas gathering operations could</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">18</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="776" height="2" alt="image" src="NYSE_AMID_2012/Image_031.png"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">be adversely affected should they be subject to more stringent application of state or federal regulation of rates and services. Our natural gas gathering operations also may be or become subject to additional safety and operational regulations relating to the design, installation, testing, construction, operation, replacement and management of gathering facilities. Additional rules and legislation pertaining to these matters are considered or adopted from time to time. We cannot predict what effect, if any, such changes might have on our operations, but the industry could be required to incur additional capital expenditures and increased costs depending on future legislative and regulatory changes.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Our natural gas gathering operations are subject to ratable take and common purchaser statutes in most of the states in which we operate. These statutes generally require our gathering pipelines to take natural gas without undue discrimination as to source of supply or producer. These statutes are designed to prohibit discrimination in favor of one producer over another producer or one source of supply over another source of supply. The regulations under these statutes can have the effect of imposing some restrictions on our ability as an owner of gathering facilities to decide with whom we contract to gather natural gas. The states in which we operate have adopted a complaint-based regulation of natural gas gathering activities, which allows natural gas producers and shippers to file complaints with state regulators in an effort to resolve grievances relating to gathering access and rate discrimination. We cannot predict whether such a complaint will be filed against us in the future. Failure to comply with state regulations can result in the imposition of administrative, civil and criminal remedies. To date, there has been no adverse effect to our system due to these regulations.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Market Behavior Rules; Posting and Reporting Requirements</h4><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">On August 8, 2005, Congress enacted the Energy Policy Act of 2005, (“EPAct 2005”). Among other matters, the EPAct 2005 amended the NGA to add an anti-manipulation provision which makes it unlawful for any entity to engage in prohibited behavior in contravention of rules and regulations to be prescribed by FERC and, furthermore, provides FERC with additional civil penalty authority. On January 19, 2006, FERC issued Order No. 670, a rule implementing the anti-manipulation provision of the EPAct 2005, and subsequently denied rehearing. The rules make it unlawful for any entity, directly or indirectly in connection with the purchase or sale of natural gas subject to the jurisdiction of FERC or the purchase or sale of transportation services subject to the jurisdiction of FERC to (1) use or employ any device, scheme or artifice to defraud;</p><ol id="l16"><li style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: -14pt;text-align: justify;"><p style="display: inline;">to make any untrue statement of material fact or omit to make any such statement necessary to make the statements made not misleading; or</p></li><li style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><p style="display: inline;">to engage in any act or practice that operates as a fraud or deceit upon any person. The new anti-manipulation rules apply to interstate gas pipelines and storage companies and intrastate gas pipelines and storage companies that provide interstate services, such as Section 311 service, as well as otherwise non-jurisdictional entities to the extent the activities are conducted “in connection with” gas sales, purchases or transportation subject to FERC jurisdiction. The new anti-manipulation rules do not apply to activities that relate only to intrastate or other non- jurisdictional sales or gathering, but only to the extent such transactions do not have a “nexus” to jurisdictional transactions. The EPAct 2005 also amends the NGA and the NGPA to give FERC authority to impose civil penalties for violations of these statutes, up to $1,000,000 per day per violation for violations occurring after August 8, 2005. In connection with this enhanced civil penalty authority, FERC issued a policy statement on enforcement to provide guidance regarding the enforcement of the statutes, orders, rules and regulations it administers, including factors to be considered in determining the appropriate enforcement action to be taken. Should we fail to comply with all applicable FERC- administered statutes, rule, regulations and orders, we could be subject to substantial penalties and fines.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The EPAct of 2005 also added a section 23 to the NGA authorizing the FERC to facilitate price transparency in markets for the sale or transportation of physical natural gas in interstate commerce. In 2007, FERC took steps to enhance its market oversight and monitoring of the natural gas industry by issuing several rulemaking orders designed to promote gas price transparency and to prevent market manipulation. In December 2007, FERC issued a final rule on the annual natural gas transaction reporting requirements, as amended by subsequent orders on rehearing, or Order No. 704. Order No. 704 requires buyers and sellers of annual quantities of natural gas of 2,200,000 MMBtu or more, including entities not otherwise subject to FERC jurisdiction, to submit on May 1 of each year an annual report to FERC describing their aggregate volumes of natural gas purchased or sold at wholesale in the prior calendar year to the extent such transactions utilize, contribute to or may contribute to the formation of price indices. Order No. 704 also requires market participants to indicate whether they report prices to any index publishers and, if so, whether their reporting complies with FERC’s policy statement on price reporting. In June 2010, the FERC issued the last of its three orders on rehearing further clarifying its requirements.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">In May 2010, the FERC issued Order No. 735, which requires intrastate pipelines providing transportation services under Section 311 of the NGPA and Hinshaw pipelines operating under Section 1(c) of the NGA to report on a quarterly basis more detailed transportation and storage transaction information, including: rates charged by the pipeline under each contract; receipt and delivery points and zones or segments covered by each contract; the quantity of natural gas the shipper is entitled to transport, store, or deliver; the duration of the contract; and whether there is an affiliate relationship between the pipeline and the shipper. Order No. 735 further requires that such information must be supplied through a new electronic reporting system and will be posted on FERC’s website, and that such quarterly reports may not contain information redacted as privileged. The FERC promulgated this rule after determining that such transactional information would help shippers make more informed purchasing</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">19</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 2pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="764" height="2" alt="image" src="NYSE_AMID_2012/Image_032.png"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">decisions and would improve the ability of both shippers and the FERC to monitor actual transactions for evidence of market power or undue discrimination. Order No. 735 also extends the Commission’s periodic review of the rates charged by the subject pipelines from three years to five years. Order No. 735 became effective on April 1, 2011. In December 2010, the Commission issued Order No. 735-A. In Order No. 735-A, the Commission generally reaffirmed Order No. 735 requiring section 311 and “Hinshaw” pipelines to report on a quarterly basis storage and transportation transactions containing specific information for each transaction, aggregated by contract.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">In July 2010, for the first time the FERC issued an order finding that the prohibition against buy/sell arrangements applies to interstate open access services provided by Section 311 and Hinshaw pipelines. The FERC denied the numerous requests for rehearing of the July order. However, in October 2010, the FERC issued a Notice of Inquiry seeking public comment on the issue of whether and how parties that hold firm capacity on some intrastate pipelines can allow others to use their capacity, including to what extent buy/sell transactions should permitted and whether the FERC should consider requiring such pipelines to offer capacity release programs. In the Notice of Inquiry, the FERC granted a blanket waiver regarding such transactions while the FERC is considering these policy issues. The comment period has ended but the FERC has not issued an order.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Offshore Natural Gas Pipelines</h4><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Our offshore natural gas gathering pipelines are subject to federal regulation under the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act, which requires that all pipelines operating on or across the outer continental shelf provide open and nondiscriminatory access to shippers. From 1982 until 2012, the Minerals Management Service (“MMS”), of the U.S. Department of the Interior (“DOI”), was the federal agency that managed the nation’s oil, natural gas, and other mineral resources on the outer continental shelf, which is all submerged lands lying seaward of state coastal waters which are under U.S. jurisdiction, and collected, accounted for, and disbursed revenues from federal offshore mineral leases. On June 18, 2010, the Minerals Management Service was renamed the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Regulation and Enforcement (“BOEMRE”). In October 2011, the BOEMRE was reorganized into and replaced by two separate agencies, the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) and the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (BSEE). The BOEM manages the exploration and development of the nation&#39;s offshore resources. BOEM seeks to appropriately balance economic development, energy independence, and environmental protection through oil and gas leases, renewable energy development and environmental reviews and studies.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">BSEE works to promote safety, protect the environment, and conserve resources offshore through vigorous regulatory oversight and enforcement.</p><h4 style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Sales of Natural Gas and NGLs</h4><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The price at which we sell natural gas is not currently subject to federal rate regulation and, for the most part, is not subject to state regulation. However, with regard to our physical sales of these energy commodities, we are required to observe anti-market manipulation laws and related regulations enforced by the FERC and/or the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (“CFTC”), and the Federal Trade Commission, or FTC. Should we violate the anti-market manipulation laws and regulations, we could also be subject to related third-party damage claims by, among others, sellers, royalty owners and taxing authorities.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Sales of NGLs are not currently regulated and are made at negotiated prices. Nevertheless, Congress could enact price controls in the future.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">As discussed above, the price and terms of access to pipeline transportation are subject to extensive federal and state regulation. The FERC is continually proposing and implementing new rules and regulations affecting interstate natural gas pipelines and those initiatives may also affect the intrastate transportation of natural gas both directly and indirectly.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s6" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Environmental Matters</p><h4 style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">General</h4><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Our operation of pipelines, plants and other facilities for the gathering, compressing, treating and transporting of natural gas and other products is subject to stringent and complex federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment. As an owner or operator of these facilities, we must comply with these laws and regulations at the federal, state and local levels. These laws and regulations can restrict or impact our business activities in many ways, such as:</p><ul id="l17"><li style="padding-left: 37pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">requiring the installation of pollution-control equipment or otherwise restricting the way we operate;</p></li><li style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 37pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">limiting or prohibiting construction activities in sensitive areas, such as wetlands, coastal regions or areas inhabited by endangered or threatened species;</p></li><li style="padding-left: 37pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">delaying system modification or upgrades during permit reviews;</p></li><li style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 37pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">requiring investigatory and remedial actions to mitigate pollution conditions caused by our operations or attributable to former operations; and</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">20</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 2pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="764" height="2" alt="image" src="NYSE_AMID_2012/Image_033.png"/></span></p></li><li style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 37pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">enjoining the operations of facilities deemed to be in non-compliance with permits issued pursuant to such environmental laws and regulations.</p></li></ul></li></ol><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may trigger a variety of administrative, civil and criminal enforcement measures, including the assessment of monetary penalties. Certain environmental statutes impose strict joint and several liability for costs required to clean up and restore sites where substances, hydrocarbons or wastes have been disposed or otherwise released. Moreover, it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the release of hazardous substances, hydrocarbons or other waste products into the environment.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The trend in environmental regulation is to place more restrictions and limitations on activities that may affect the environment, and thus, there can be no assurance as to the amount or timing of future expenditures for environmental compliance or remediation and actual future expenditures may be different from the amounts we currently anticipate. We try to anticipate future regulatory requirements that might be imposed and plan accordingly to remain in compliance with changing environmental laws and regulations and to minimize the costs of such compliance. We also actively participate in industry groups that help formulate recommendations for addressing existing or future regulations.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">We do not believe that compliance with federal, state or local environmental laws and regulations will have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position or results of operations or cash flows. In addition, we believe that the various environmental activities in which we are presently engaged are not expected to materially interrupt or diminish our operational ability to gather, compress, treat and transport natural gas. We cannot assure, however, that future events, such as changes in existing laws or enforcement policies, the promulgation of new laws or regulations or the development or discovery of new facts or conditions will not cause us to incur significant costs. Below is a discussion of the material environmental laws and regulations that relate to our business. We believe that we are in substantial compliance with all of these environmental laws and regulations.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Hazardous Substances and Waste</h4><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Our operations are subject to environmental laws and regulations relating to the management and release of hazardous substances, solid and hazardous wastes and petroleum hydrocarbons. These laws generally regulate the generation, storage, treatment, transportation and disposal of solid and hazardous waste and may impose strict joint and several liability for the investigation and remediation of affected areas where hazardous substances may have been released or disposed. For instance, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (“CERCLA” or the “Superfund law”), and comparable state laws impose liability, without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct, on certain classes of persons that contributed to the release of a hazardous substance into the environment. We may handle hazardous substances within the meaning of CERCLA, or similar state statutes, in the course of our ordinary operations and, as a result, may be jointly and severally liable under CERCLA for all or part of the costs required to clean up sites at which these hazardous substances have been released into the environment.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">We also generate industrial wastes that are subject to the requirements of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (“RCRA”), and comparable state statutes. While RCRA regulates both solid and hazardous wastes, it imposes strict requirements on the generation, storage, treatment, transportation and disposal of hazardous wastes. We generate little hazardous waste; however, it is possible that these wastes, which could include wastes currently generated during our operations, will in the future be designated as “hazardous wastes” and, therefore, be subject to more rigorous and costly disposal requirements. Any such changes in the laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our maintenance capital expenditures and operating expenses.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">We currently own or lease, and our Predecessor has in the past owned or leased, properties where hydrocarbons are being or have been handled for many years. Although previous operators have utilized operating and disposal practices that were standard in the industry at the time, hydrocarbons or other wastes may have been disposed of or released on or under the properties owned or leased by us or on or under the other locations where these hydrocarbons and wastes have been transported for treatment or disposal. These properties and the wastes disposed thereon may be subject to CERCLA, RCRA and analogous state laws. Under these laws, we could be required to remove or remediate previously disposed wastes (including wastes  disposed of or released by prior owners  or operators), to clean up contaminated property (including contaminated groundwater) or to perform remedial operations to prevent future contamination. We are not currently aware of any facts, events or conditions relating to such requirements that could materially impact our operations or financial condition.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Oil Pollution Act</h4><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">In January of 1974, the EPA adopted regulations under the Oil Pollution Act (“OPA”). These oil pollution prevention regulations require the preparation of a Spill Prevention Control and Countermeasure Plan (“SPCC”) for facilities engaged in drilling, producing, gathering, storing, processing, refining, transferring, distributing, using, or consuming oil and oil products, and which due to their location, could reasonably be expected to discharge oil in harmful quantities into or upon the navigable waters of the United States. The owner or operator of an SPCC- regulated facility is required to prepare a written, site-specific spill prevention plan, which details how a facility’s operations comply with the requirements. To be in compliance, the facility’s SPCC plan must</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">21</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 2pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="776" height="2" alt="image" src="NYSE_AMID_2012/Image_034.png"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">satisfy all of the applicable requirements for drainage, bulk storage tanks, tank car and truck loading and unloading, transfer operations (intrafacility piping), inspections and records, security, and training. Most importantly, the facility must fully implement the SPCC plan and train personnel in its execution. We believe that our facilities will not be materially adversely affected by such requirements, and the requirements are not expected to be any more burdensome to us than to any other similarly situated companies.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Air Emissions</h4><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Our operations are subject to the federal Clean Air Act and comparable state and local laws and regulations. These laws and regulations regulate emissions of air pollutants from various industrial sources, including our compressor stations and processing plants, and also impose various monitoring and reporting requirements. Such laws and regulations may require that we obtain pre-approval for the construction or modification of certain projects or facilities expected to produce or significantly increase air emissions, obtain and strictly comply with air permits containing various emissions and operational limitations and utilize specific emission control technologies to limit emissions. Our failure to comply with these requirements could subject us to monetary penalties, injunctions, conditions or restrictions on operations and, potentially, criminal enforcement actions. Other than as described below with respect to our Bazor Ridge and Chatom systems, we believe that we are in substantial compliance with these requirements. We may be required to incur certain capital expenditures in the future for air pollution control equipment in connection with obtaining and maintaining operating permits and approvals for air emissions. We believe, however, that our operations will not be materially adversely affected by such requirements, and the requirements are not expected to be any more burdensome to us than to any other similarly situated companies.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Our Bazor Ridge processing plant processes natural gas that is high in hydrogen sulfide, or H <span class="s10">2 </span>S. This plant has a Title V Air Permit, which is a permit issued pursuant to Title V of the federal Clean Air Act for larger sources of air emissions. In Mississippi, where the Bazor Ridge plant is located, the Title V program is administered by the Mississippi Department of Environmental Quality (“MDEQ”). Under this permit, we are allowed to emit up to a specified level of sulfur dioxide, or SO <span class="s10">2 </span>, per year.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">In the course of preparing our annual MDEQ filing for 2010 as required by our Title V Air Permit, we determined that we underreported to MDEQ the SO <span class="s10">2 </span>emissions from the Bazor Ridge plant for 2009 and 2010. Moreover, we discovered that SO <span class="s10">2 </span>emission levels during 2009 may have exceeded the threshold that triggers the need for a Prevention of Significant Deterioration (“PSD”), permit under the federal Clean Air Act. No PSD permit has been issued for the Bazor Ridge plant. In addition, we recently determined that certain SO <span class="s10">2 </span>emissions during 2009 and 2010 exceeded the reportable quantity threshold under the federal Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (“EPCRA”), requiring notification of various governmental authorities. We did not make any such EPCRA notifications. In July 2011, we self-reported these issues to the MDEQ and EPA Region IV. In January 2012, we met with EPA Region IV representatives, and have agreed to a settlement with respect to the EPCRA reporting issue. A Consent Agreement and Final Order was executed, which included a civil penalty of $23,010 . After discussion <span class="s26">with the MDEQ, in February 2012 we submitted an application to amend our Title V Air Permit to account for these SO </span><span class="s27">2 </span><span class="s26">emissions. The MDEQ </span>has processed this permit application. In December 2011, EPA Region IV performed an inspection of the plant, and they followed up with an Information Request in May 2012. We have responded to this Information Request and do not anticipate any further action required by the Partnership at this time.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">On March 11, 2013, the Environmental Protection Agency issued a Clean Air Act Compliance Order related to an inspection of the Chatom processing plant on May 15, 2012. The order was issued to Quantum Resources Management, LLC, the owner at the time of the inspection. EPA has requested information regarding releases identified during the inspection, including a description of the equipment and repairs that were performed. We will timely respond to this request. At this time, we cannot determine whether EPA may pursue further enforcement related to these releases and cannot predict the amount of any potential fines or penalties.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Water Discharges</h4><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The Federal Water Pollution Control Act (“Clean Water Act”), and analogous state laws impose restrictions and strict controls regarding the discharge of pollutants into state waters as well as waters of the U.S. and to conduct construction activities in waters and wetlands. Certain state regulations and the general permits issued under the Federal National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System program prohibit the discharge of pollutants and chemicals. Spill prevention, control and countermeasure requirements of federal laws require appropriate containment berms and similar structures to help prevent the contamination of regulated waters in the event of a hydrocarbon tank spill, rupture or leak. In addition, the Clean Water Act and analogous state laws require individual permits or coverage under general permits for discharges of storm water runoff from certain types of facilities. These permits may require us to monitor and sample the storm water runoff from certain of our facilities. Some states also maintain groundwater protection programs that require permits for discharges or operations that may impact groundwater conditions. Federal and state regulatory agencies can impose administrative, civil and criminal penalties for non-compliance with discharge permits or other requirements of the Clean Water Act and analogous state laws and regulations. We believe that compliance with existing permits</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">22</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="776" height="2" alt="image" src="NYSE_AMID_2012/Image_035.png"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">and compliance with foreseeable new permit requirements will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flow.</p><h4 style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Safe Drinking Water Act</h4><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The underground injection of oil and natural gas wastes are regulated by the Underground Injection Control program authorized by the Safe Drinking Water Act. The primary objective of injection well operating requirements is to ensure the mechanical integrity of the injection apparatus and to prevent migration of fluids from the injection zone into underground sources of drinking water. We own and operate an acid gas disposal well in Wayne County, Mississippi as part of our Bazor Ridge gas treating facilities. This well takes a combination of hydrogen sulfide and carbon dioxide recovered from the raw field natural gas feeding the Bazor Ridge Gas plant and injects it into an underground formation permitted for this purpose. The well received an Underground Injection Control (“UIC”) Class 2 permit through the Mississippi state oil and gas board in 1999. As part of our permit requirements, we perform regular inspection, maintenance and reporting to the state on the condition and operations of this well which is adjacent to our processing plant. We believe that our facilities will not be materially adversely affected by such requirements.</p><h4 style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Endangered Species</h4><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The Endangered Species Act (“ESA”), restricts activities that may affect endangered or threatened species or their habitats. While some of our pipelines may be located in areas that are designated as habitats for endangered or threatened species, we believe that we are in substantial compliance with the ESA. However, the designation of previously unidentified endangered or threatened species could cause us to incur additional costs or become subject to operating restrictions or bans in the affected states.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">National Environmental Policy Act</h4><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The National Environmental Policy Act (“NEPA”), establishes a national environmental policy and goals for the protection, maintenance, and enhancement of the environment and provides a process for implementing these goals within federal agencies. A major federal agency action having the potential to significantly impact the environment requires review under NEPA and, as a result, many activities requiring FERC approval must undergo NEPA review. Many of our activities are covered under categorical exclusions which results in a shorter NEPA review process. The Council on Environmental Quality has announced an intention to reinvigorate NEPA reviews which may result in longer review processes that could lead to delays and increased costs that could materially adversely affect our revenues and results of operations.</p><h4 style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Climate Change</h4><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Recent scientific studies have suggested that emissions of certain gases, commonly referred to as “greenhouse gases” (“GHG”) and including carbon dioxide and methane, may be contributing to warming of the Earth’s atmosphere. In response to the scientific studies, international negotiations to address climate change have occurred. The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, also known as the “Kyoto Protocol,” became effective on February 16, 2005 as a result of these negotiations, but the United States did not ratify the Kyoto Protocol. At the end of 2009, an international conference to develop a successor to the Kyoto Protocol issued a document known as the Copenhagen Accord. Pursuant to the Copenhagen Accord, the United States submitted a greenhouse gas emission reduction target of 17 percent compared to 2005 levels. We continue to monitor the international efforts to address climate change. Their effect on our operations cannot be determined with any certainty at this time.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">In the U.S., legislative and regulatory initiatives are underway to limit GHG emissions. The U.S. Congress has considered legislation that would control GHG emissions through a “cap and trade” program and several states have already implemented programs to reduce GHG emissions. The U.S. Supreme Court determined that GHG emissions fall within the federal Clean Air Act (“CAA”), definition of an “air pollutant,” and in response the EPA promulgated an endangerment finding paving the way for regulation of GHG emissions under the CAA. In 2010, the EPA issued a final rule, known as the “Tailoring Rule,” that makes certain large stationary sources and modification projects subject to permitting requirements for greenhouse gas emissions under the Clean Air Act.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">In addition, on September 2009, the EPA issued a final rule requiring the reporting of GHGs from specified large GHG emission sources in the</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">U.S. beginning in 2011 for emissions in 2010. Our Bazor Ridge and Chatom systems are currently required to and have reported under this rule in 2012 and 2011. On November 30, 2010, the EPA published a final rule expanding its existing GHG emissions reporting to include onshore and offshore oil and natural gas systems beginning in 2012. We timely filed emissions reports for our Bazor Ridge and Chatom systems.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Because regulation of GHG emissions is relatively new, further regulatory, legislative and judicial developments are likely to occur. Such developments may affect how these GHG initiatives will impact us. Due to the uncertainties surrounding the regulation of and other risks associated with GHG emissions, we cannot predict the financial impact of related developments on us.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Legislation or regulations that may be adopted to address climate change could also affect the markets for our products by making our products more or less desirable than competing sources of energy. To the extent that our products are competing with higher greenhouse gas emitting energy sources such as coal, our products would become more desirable in the market with more stringent</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">23</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 2pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="764" height="2" alt="image" src="NYSE_AMID_2012/Image_036.png"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">limitations on greenhouse gas emissions. To the extent that our products are competing with lower greenhouse gas emitting energy sources such as solar and wind, our products would become less desirable in the market with more stringent limitations on greenhouse gas emissions. We cannot predict with any certainty at this time how these possibilities may affect our operations.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The majority of scientific studies on climate change suggest that stronger storms may occur in the future in the areas where we operate, although the scientific studies are not unanimous. Due to their location, our operations along the Gulf Coast are vulnerable to operational and structural damages resulting from hurricanes and other severe weather systems and our insurance may not cover all associated losses. We are taking steps to mitigate physical risks from storms, but no assurance can be given that future storms will not have a material adverse effect on our business.</p><h4 style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Anti-terrorism Measures</h4><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The Department of Homeland Security Appropriation Act of 2007 requires the Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”), to issue regulations establishing risk-based performance standards for the security of chemical and industrial facilities, including oil and gas facilities that are deemed to present “high levels of security risk.” The DHS issued an interim final rule in April 2007 regarding risk-based performance standards to be attained pursuant to this act and, on November 20, 2007, further issued an Appendix A to the interim rules that establish chemicals of interest and their respective threshold quantities that will trigger compliance with these interim rules. Covered facilities that are determined by DHS to pose a high level of security risk will be required to prepare and submit Security Vulnerability Assessments and Site Security Plans as well as comply with other regulatory requirements, including those regarding inspections, audits, recordkeeping, and protection of chemical- terrorism vulnerability information. Three of our facilities have more than the threshold quantity of listed chemicals; therefore, a “Top Screen” evaluation was submitted to the DHS. The DHS reviewed this information and made the determination that none of the facilities are considered high-risk chemical facilities.</p><p class="s6" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Title to Properties and Rights-of-Way</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Our real property falls into two categories: (1) parcels that we own in fee and (2) parcels in which our interest derives from leases, easements, rights-of-way, permits or licenses from landowners or governmental authorities, permitting the use of such land for our operations. Portions of the land on which our plants and other major facilities are located are owned by us in fee title, and we believe that we have satisfactory title to these lands. The remaining land on which our plant sites and major facilities are located, are held by us pursuant to surface leases between us, as lessee, and the fee owner of the lands, as lessors. Our Predecessors leased or owned these lands for many years without any material challenge known to us relating to the title to the land upon which the assets are located, and we believe that we have satisfactory leasehold estates or fee ownership in such lands. We have no knowledge of any challenge to the underlying fee title of any material lease, easement, right-of-way, permit or license held by us or to our title to any material lease, easement, right-of-way, permit or lease, and we believe that we have satisfactory title to all of our material leases, easements, rights-of-way, permits and licenses.</p><p class="s6" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Employees</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">We do not have any employees. The officers of our general partner manage our operations and activities. As of December 31, 2012, our general partner employed approximately 107 people who provide direct, full-time support to our operations. All of the employees required to conduct and support our operations are employed by our general partner. None of these employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements, and our general partner considers its employee relations to be good.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s6" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Item 1A. Risk Factors</p><p class="s25" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Limited partner units are inherently different from capital stock of a corporation, although many of the business risks to which we are subject are similar to those that would be faced by a corporation engaged in similar businesses. We urge you to carefully consider the following risk factors together with all of the other information included in our IPO offering document in evaluating an investment in our common units.</p><p class="s25" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">If any of the following risks were to occur, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected. In that case, we might not be able to pay the minimum quarterly distribution on our common units, the trading price of our common units could decline and you could lose all or part of your investment in us.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s6" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Risks Related to our Business</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 71%;text-align: justify;">Our June 2012 amended credit facility includes financial covenants and ratios.

Our failure to comply with any of the covenants under our June 2012 amended credit facility could result in a default, which could cause all of our existing indebtedness to become immediately due and payable. We were unable to maintain compliance with consolidated total leverage ratio required by our June 2012 amended credit agreement as it existed prior to the Fourth Amendment during the quarters ended December 31, 2012 and March 31, 2013. On April 15, 2013, we entered into a Fourth Amendment to our June 2012 amended credit agreement that, among other things, modified the maximum permitted consolidated total leverage ratio.

As a result, our cash flows associated with these wells will also decline over time. In order to maintain or increase throughput levels on our systems, we must obtain new sources of natural gas.

In addition, we have no control over producers or their drilling or production decisions, which are affected by, among other things:</p></li><li style="padding-left: 37pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">the availability and cost of capital;</p></li><li style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 37pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">prevailing and projected oil and natural gas and NGL prices;</p></li><li style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 37pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">demand for oil, natural gas and NGLs;</p></li><li style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 37pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">levels of reserves;</p></li><li style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 37pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">geological considerations;</p></li><li style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 37pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">environmental or other governmental regulations, including the availability of drilling permits; and</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">25</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="776" height="2" alt="image" src="NYSE_AMID_2012/Image_038.png"/></span></p></li><li style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 37pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">the availability of drilling rigs and other production and development costs.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Fluctuations in energy prices can also greatly affect the development of new oil and natural gas reserves. Further declines in natural gas prices could have a negative impact on exploration, development and production activity, and if sustained, could lead to a material decrease in such activity. Sustained reductions in exploration or production activity in our areas of operation would lead to reduced utilization of our assets.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Because of these and other factors, even if new natural gas reserves are known to exist in areas served by our assets, producers may choose not to develop those reserves. If reductions in drilling activity result in our inability to maintain the current levels of throughput on our systems, it could reduce our revenue and cash flow and adversely affect our ability to make cash distributions to our unitholders.</p><h4 style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 71%;text-align: justify;">Natural gas, NGL and other commodity prices are volatile, and a reduction in these prices in absolute terms, or an adverse change in the prices of natural gas and NGLs relative to one another, could adversely affect our gross margin and cash flow and our ability to make distributions to our unitholders.</h4><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">We are subject to risks due to frequent and often substantial fluctuations in commodity prices. In the past, the prices of natural gas and crude oil have been extremely volatile, and we expect this volatility to continue. The NYMEX daily settlement price for natural gas for the forward month contract in 2012 ranged from a high of $3.90 per MMBtu to a low of $1.91 per MMBtu. Natural gas prices reached relatively high levels in 2005 and early 2006 and have exhibited significant volatility since then, including a sustained decline beginning in 2008, with the forward month gas futures contracts closing at a seven-year low of $2.32 per MMBtu in January 2012. NGL prices are generally positively correlated to the price of WTI crude oil, which has also exhibited frequent and substantial fluctuations. The NYMEX daily settlement price for WTI crude oil for the forward month contract in 2012 ranged from a high of $109.77 per Bbl to a low of $77.69 per Bbl. Crude oil prices reached historically high levels in July 2008, hitting a peak of $145.29 per Bbl, and have demonstrated substantial volatility since then, with the forward month crude oil futures contracts ranging from $33.87 per Bbl in December 2008 to above $113.93 per Bbl in April 2011.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The markets for and prices of natural gas, NGLs and other hydrocarbon commodities depend on factors that are beyond our control. These factors include the supply of and demand for these commodities, which fluctuate with changes in market and economic conditions and other factors, including:</p></li><li style="padding-left: 37pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">worldwide economic conditions;</p></li><li style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 37pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">worldwide political events, including actions taken by foreign oil and gas producing nations;</p></li><li style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 37pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">worldwide weather events and conditions, including natural disasters and seasonal changes;</p></li><li style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 37pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">the levels of domestic production and consumer demand;</p></li><li style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 37pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">the availability of imported liquefied natural gas, or LNG;</p></li><li style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 37pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">the availability of transportation systems with adequate capacity;</p></li><li style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 37pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">the volatility and uncertainty of regional pricing differentials;</p></li><li style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 37pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">the price and availability of alternative fuels;</p></li><li style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 37pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">the effect of energy conservation measures;</p></li><li style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 37pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">the nature and extent of governmental regulation and taxation; and</p></li><li style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 37pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">the anticipated future prices of oil, natural gas, NGLs and other commodities.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">In our Gathering and Processing segment, we have exposure to direct commodity price risk under percent-of-proceeds processing contracts as well as under our elective processing arrangements. Under percent-of-proceeds arrangements, we generally purchase natural gas from producers and retain an agreed percentage of the proceeds (in cash or in-kind) from the sale at market prices of pipeline-quality natural gas and NGLs resulting from our processing activities. We also purchase natural gas at various receipt points, process the gas at a third-party owned natural gas processing facility and sell our portion of the residue gas and NGLs. Under percent-of-proceeds arrangements, our revenue and our cash flows increase or decrease as the prices of natural gas and NGLs fluctuate. When we process natural gas that we purchase for our own account, the relationship between natural gas prices and NGL prices also affects our profitability. When natural gas prices are low relative to NGL prices, it is more profitable for us to process the natural gas that we purchase and process for our own account. When natural gas prices are high relative to NGL prices, it is less profitable for us and our customers to process natural gas both because of the higher value of natural gas and because of the increased cost (principally that of natural gas shrink that occurs during processing and use of natural gas as a fuel) of separating the mixed NGLs from the natural gas. As a result, we may experience periods in which higher natural gas prices relative to NGL prices reduce our processing margins or reduce the volume of natural gas processed pursuant to our elective processing arrangements. For the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, percent-of-proceeds arrangements accounted for approximately 51.4% and 41.3%, respectively, of our gross margin, or 69.8% and 58.8%, respectively, of the segment gross margin in our Gathering and Processing segment.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">26</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="776" height="2" alt="image" src="NYSE_AMID_2012/Image_039.png"/></span></p><h4 style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 70%;text-align: justify;">A decrease in demand for natural gas, NGLs or condensate by the petrochemical, refining or heating industries, could adversely affect the profitability of our midstream business.</h4><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">A decrease in demand for natural gas, NGLs or condensate by the petrochemical, refining or heating industries, could adversely affect the profitability of our midstream business. Various factors impact the demand for natural gas, NGLs and condensate, including general economic conditions, extended periods of ethane rejection, increased competition from petroleum-based products due to pricing differences, adverse weather conditions, availability of natural gas processing and transportation capacity and government regulations affecting prices and production levels of natural gas, NGLs and condensate.</p><h4 style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 71%;text-align: justify;">Our hedging activities may not be effective in reducing our direct exposure to commodity price risk and the variability of our cash flows and may, in certain circumstances, increase the variability of our cash flows.</h4><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">We have entered into derivative transactions related to only a portion of the equity volumes of NGLs to which we take title. As a result, we will continue to have direct commodity price risk to the unhedged portion of our NGL equity volumes. We currently have no hedges in place beyond December 2013. Our actual future volumes may be significantly higher or lower than we estimated at the time we entered into the derivative transactions for that period. If the actual amount is higher than we estimated, we will have greater commodity price risk than we intended. If the actual amount is lower than the amount that is subject to our derivative financial instruments, we might be forced to satisfy all or a portion of our derivative transactions without the benefit of the cash flow from our sale of the underlying physical commodity, resulting in a reduction of our liquidity. The derivative instruments we utilize for these hedges are based on posted market prices, which may be lower than the actual NGL prices that we realize in our operations. As a result of these factors, our hedging activities may not be as effective as we intend in reducing the variability of our cash flows, and in certain circumstances may actually increase the variability of our cash flows. To the extent we hedge our commodity price risk, we may forego the benefits we would otherwise experience if commodity prices were to change in our favor. We do not enter into derivative transactions with respect to the volumes of natural gas or condensate that we purchase and sell.</p><h4 style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">We may not successfully balance our purchases and sales of natural gas, which would increase our exposure to commodity price risks.</h4><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">We purchase from producers and other suppliers a substantial amount of the natural gas that flows through our pipelines and processing facilities for sale to third parties, including natural gas marketers and other purchasers. We are exposed to fluctuations in the price of natural gas through volumes sold pursuant to percent-of-proceeds arrangements as well as through volumes sold pursuant to our fixed-margin contracts.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">In order to mitigate our direct commodity price exposure, we do not enter into natural gas hedge contracts, but rather attempt to balance our natural gas sales with our natural gas purchases on an aggregate basis across all of our systems. We may not be successful in balancing our purchases and sales, and as such may become exposed to fluctuations in the price of natural gas. For example, we are currently net purchasers of natural gas on certain of our systems and net sellers of natural gas on certain of our other systems. Our overall net position with respect to natural gas can change over time and our exposure to fluctuations in natural gas prices could materially increase, which in turn could result in increased volatility in our revenue, gross margin and cash flows.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Although we enter into back-to-back purchases and sales of natural gas in our fixed-margin contracts in which we purchase natural gas from producers or suppliers at receipt points on our systems and simultaneously sell an identical volume of natural gas at delivery points on our systems, we may still be exposed to commodity price risks. For example, the volumes or timing of our purchases and sales may not correspond. In addition, a producer or supplier could fail to deliver contracted volumes or deliver in excess of contracted volumes, or a purchaser could purchase less than contracted volumes. Any of these actions could cause our purchases and sales to become unbalanced. If our purchases and sales are unbalanced, we will face increased exposure to commodity price risks, which in turn could result in increased volatility in our revenue, gross margin and cash flows.</p><h4 style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 71%;text-align: justify;">We are a relatively small enterprise, and our management has limited history with our assets and limited experience in managing our business as a publicly traded partnership. As a result, operational, financial and other events in the ordinary course of business could disproportionately affect us, and our ability to grow our business could be significantly limited.</h4><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">We will be smaller than many of the other companies in our industry for the foreseeable future, not only in terms of market capitalization but also in terms of managerial, operational and financial resources. Consequently, an operational incident, customer loss or other event that would not significantly impact the business and operations of the larger companies in our industry may have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations. In addition, our executive management team is relatively small with limited experience in managing our business as a publicly traded partnership and has managed our business and assets for less than four years. As a result, we may not be able to anticipate or respond to material changes or other events in our business as effectively as if our executive management team had such experience and had managed our business and assets for many years.

Effective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable and timely financial reports, prevent fraud and to operate successfully as a publicly traded partnership. We prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP, but our internal accounting controls may not meet all standards applicable to companies with publicly traded securities. Our efforts to develop and maintain our internal controls may not be successful, and we may be unable to maintain effective controls over our financial processes and reporting in the future or to comply with our obligations under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, which we refer to as Section 404. For example, Section 404 requires us, among other things, to annually review and report on, and our independent registered public accounting firm to attest to, the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting (an independent attestation was not required for 2012 due to our non-accelerated filer status). We have implemented an internal control environment to comply with Section 404 for our fiscal year ending December 31, 2012. Any failure to develop, implement or maintain effective internal controls or to improve our internal controls could harm our operating results or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">We currently have limited accounting personnel, and while we continue to evaluate the adequacy of our accounting personnel staffing level and other matters related to our internal controls over financial reporting, we cannot predict the outcome of the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Given the difficulties inherent in the design and operation of internal controls over financial reporting, in addition to our limited accounting personnel and management resources, we can provide no assurance as to our, or our independent registered public accounting firm’s, future conclusions about the effectiveness of our internal controls, and we may incur significant costs in our efforts to comply with Section 404. Any failure to implement and maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting will subject us to regulatory scrutiny and a loss of confidence in our reported financial information, which could have an adverse effect on our business and would likely have a negative effect on the trading price of our common units.</p><h4 style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 71%;text-align: justify;">We depend on a relatively small number of customers for a significant portion of our gross margin.

Additionally, a number of customers upon which our business depends are small companies that may in the future have limited access to capital or that may, as a result of operational incidents or other events, be disproportionately affected as compared to larger, better capitalized companies. For information regarding our concentration of customers and associated credit risk by segment, please refer to Part I, Item 1. Business in this Annual Report. Although we have gathering, processing or transmission contracts with significant customers of varying duration and commercial terms, if one or more of these customers were to default on their contract or if we were unable to renew our contract with one or more of these customers on favorable terms, we may not be able to replace any of these customers in a timely fashion, on favorable terms or at all. In any of these situations, our gross margin and cash flows and our ability to make cash distributions to our unitholders may be adversely affected. We expect our exposure to concentrated risk of non-payment or non-performance to continue as long as we remain substantially dependent on a relatively small number of customers for a substantial portion of our gross margin.</p><h4 style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 71%;text-align: justify;">If third-party pipelines or other midstream facilities interconnected to our gathering or transportation systems become partially or fully unavailable, or if the volumes we gather or transport do not meet the natural gas quality requirements of such pipelines or facilities, our revenue and cash available for distribution could be adversely affected.</h4><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Our natural gas gathering and processing and transportation systems connect to other pipelines or facilities, the majority of which, such as the Southern Natural Gas Company, or Sonat, pipeline, the Toca plant, oil gathering lines on Quivira and the Burns Point processing plant, as well as the Destin, Tennessee Gas and Transco pipelines, are owned and operated by third parties. For example, our elective processing arrangements are entirely dependent on the Toca plant for processing services and the Sonat pipeline for natural gas takeaway capacity and are substantially dependent on the Tennessee Gas Pipeline, or TGP, for natural gas supply volumes. The continuing operation of such third-party pipelines and other midstream facilities is not within our control. These pipelines and other midstream facilities may become unavailable because of testing, turnarounds, line repair, reduced operating pressure, lack of operating capacity, regulatory requirements, curtailments of receipt or deliveries due to insufficient capacity or because of damage from hurricanes or other operational hazards.

Any material nonpayment or nonperformance by any of our key customers could have a material adverse effect on our revenue, gross margin and cash flows and our ability to make cash distributions to our unitholders.</p><h4 style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Our gathering, processing and transportation contracts subject us to renewal risks.</h4><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">We gather, purchase, process, transport and sell most of the natural gas and NGLs on our systems under contracts with terms of various durations. As these contracts expire, we may have to negotiate extensions or renewals with existing suppliers and customers or enter into new contracts with other suppliers and customers. We may be unable to obtain new contracts on favorable commercial terms, if at all. We also may be unable to maintain the economic structure of a particular contract with an existing customer or the overall mix of our contract portfolio. For example, depending on prevailing market conditions at the time of a contract renewal, gathering and processing customers with percent-of- proceeds contracts may choose to switch to fee-based gathering and transportation contracts, or a producer with whom we have a natural gas purchase contract may choose to enter into a transportation contract with us and retain title to its natural gas. To the extent we are unable to renew our existing contracts on terms that are favorable to us or successfully manage our overall contract mix over time, our revenue, gross margin and cash flows could decline and our ability to make distributions to our unitholders could be materially and adversely affected.</p><h4 style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Our industry is highly competitive, and increased competitive pressure could adversely affect our business and operating results.</h4><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">We compete with other midstream companies in our areas of operation. In addition, some of our competitors are large companies that have greater financial, managerial and other resources than we do. Our competitors may expand or construct gathering, compression, treating, processing or transportation systems that would create additional competition for the services we provide to our customers. In addition, our customers may develop their own gathering, compression, treating, processing or transportation systems in lieu of using ours. Our ability to renew or replace existing contracts with our customers at rates sufficient to maintain current revenue and cash flow could be adversely affected by the activities of our competitors and our customers. All of these competitive pressures could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and ability to make cash distributions to our unitholders.</p><h4 style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 71%;text-align: justify;">Significant portions of our pipeline systems have been in service for several decades and we have a limited ownership history with respect to all of our assets. There could be unknown events or conditions or increased maintenance or repair expenses and downtime associated with our pipelines that could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.</h4><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">We purchased our assets from Enbridge in November 2009. Significant portions of the pipeline systems that we purchased have been in service for many decades. In addition, our executive management team was hired shortly before that purchase and, consequently, has a limited history of operating our assets. There may be historical occurrences or latent issues regarding our pipeline systems that our executive management may be unaware of and that may have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. The age and condition of our pipeline systems could also result in increased maintenance or repair expenditures, and any downtime associated with increased maintenance and repair activities could materially reduce our revenue. Any significant increase in maintenance and repair expenditures or loss of revenue due to the age or condition of our pipeline systems could adversely affect our business and results of operations and our ability to make cash distributions to our unitholders.</p><h4 style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 71%;text-align: justify;">We may incur significant costs and liabilities as a result of safety regulation, including pipeline integrity management program testing and related repairs.</h4><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Pursuant to the Pipeline Safety Improvement Act of 2002, as reauthorized and amended by the Pipeline Inspection, Protection, Enforcement and Safety Act of 2006, the U.S. Department of Transportation (“DOT”), has adopted regulations requiring pipeline operators to develop integrity management programs for transmission pipelines located where a leak or rupture could harm “high</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">29</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="776" height="2" alt="image" src="NYSE_AMID_2012/Image_042.png"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">consequence areas,” including high population areas, unless the operator effectively demonstrates by risk assessment that the pipeline could not affect the area. The regulations require operators, including us, to:</p></li><li style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 37pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">perform ongoing assessments of pipeline integrity;</p></li><li style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 37pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">identify and characterize applicable threats to pipeline segments that could impact a high consequence area;</p></li><li style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 37pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">maintain processes for data collection, integration and analysis;</p></li><li style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 37pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">repair and remediate pipelines as necessary; and</p></li><li style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 37pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">implement preventive and mitigating actions.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">In addition, many states have adopted regulations similar to existing DOT regulations for intrastate gathering and transmission lines. Although many of our natural gas facilities fall within a class that is not subject to these requirements, we may incur significant costs and liabilities associated with repair, remediation, preventative or mitigation measures associated with our non-exempt pipelines, particularly our AlaTenn and Midla pipelines. We currently estimate that we will incur future costs of approximately $0.1 million during 2013 to complete the testing required by existing DOT regulations. This estimate does not include the costs, if any, for repair, remediation, preventative or mitigating actions that may be determined to be necessary as a result of the testing program, which could be substantial. Such costs and liabilities might relate to repair, remediation, preventative or mitigating actions that may be determined to be necessary as a result of the testing program, as well as lost cash flows resulting from shutting down our pipelines during the pendency of such repairs. Additionally, should we fail to comply with DOT regulations, we could be subject to penalties and fines.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The Pipeline Safety, Regulatory Certainty, and Job Creation Act of 2011, which became law in January 2012, increases the penalties for safety violations, establishes additional safety requirements for newly constructed pipelines and requires studies of safety issues that could result in the adoption of new regulatory requirements for existing pipelines. In addition, PHMSA has published an advanced notice of proposed rulemaking to solicit comments on the need for changes to its safety regulations, including whether to revise the integrity management requirements or to include additional pipelines in &quot;high consequence areas&quot;. Such legislative and regulatory changes could have a material effect on our operations and costs of transportation services.</p><h4 style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 71%;text-align: justify;">We intend to grow our business in part by seeking strategic acquisition opportunities. If we are unable to make acquisitions on economically acceptable terms from third parties, our future growth will be limited, and the acquisitions we do make may reduce, rather than increase, our cash generated from operations on a per unit basis.</h4><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Our ability to grow depends, in part, on our ability to make acquisitions that increase our cash generated from operations on a per unit basis. The acquisition component of our strategy is based, in large part, on our expectation of ongoing divestitures of midstream energy assets by industry participants. A material decrease in such divestitures would limit our opportunities for future acquisitions and could adversely affect our ability to grow our operations and increase our distributions to our unitholders.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">If we are unable to make accretive acquisitions from third parties, whether because we are (i) unable to identify attractive acquisition candidates or negotiate acceptable purchase contracts, (ii) unable to obtain financing for these acquisitions on economically acceptable terms or (iii) outbid by competitors or for any other reason, then our future growth and ability to increase distributions will be limited. Furthermore, even if we do make acquisitions that we believe will be accretive, these acquisitions may nevertheless result in a decrease in the cash generated from operations on a per unit basis.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Any acquisition involves potential risks, including, among other things:</p></li><li style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 37pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">mistaken assumptions about volumes, revenue and costs, including synergies;</p></li><li style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 37pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">an inability to secure adequate customer commitments to use the acquired systems or facilities;</p></li><li style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 37pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">an inability to integrate successfully the assets or businesses we acquire, particularly given the relatively small size of our management team and its limited history with our assets;</p></li><li style="padding-left: 37pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">the assumption of unknown liabilities;</p></li><li style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 37pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">limitations on rights to indemnity from the seller;</p></li><li style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 37pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">mistaken assumptions about the overall costs of equity or debt;</p></li><li style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 37pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">the diversion of management’s and employees’ attention from other business concerns;</p></li><li style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 37pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">unforeseen difficulties operating in new geographic areas and business lines; and</p></li><li style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 37pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">customer or key employee losses at the acquired businesses.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">If we consummate any future acquisitions, our capitalization and results of operations may change significantly, and our unitholders will not have the opportunity to evaluate the economic, financial and other relevant information that we will consider in determining the application of these funds and other resources.</p><h4 style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 71%;text-align: justify;">Our construction of new assets may not result in revenue increases and will be subject to regulatory, environmental, political, legal and economic risks, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.</h4><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">30</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 2pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="764" height="2" alt="image" src="NYSE_AMID_2012/Image_043.png"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">One of the ways we intend to grow our business is through organic growth projects. The construction of additions or modifications to our existing systems and the construction of new midstream assets involve numerous regulatory, environmental, political, legal and economic uncertainties that are beyond our control. Such expansion projects may also require the expenditure of significant amounts of capital, and financing may not be available on economically acceptable terms or at all. If we undertake these projects, they may not be completed on schedule, at the budgeted cost, or at all. Moreover, our revenue may not increase immediately upon the expenditure of funds on a particular project.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">For instance, if we expand a pipeline, the construction may occur over an extended period of time, yet we will not receive any material increases in revenue until the project is completed and placed into service. Moreover, we could construct facilities to capture anticipated future growth in production in a region in which such growth does not materialize or only materializes over a period materially longer than expected. Since we are not engaged in the exploration for and development of natural gas and oil reserves, we often do not have access to third-party estimates of potential reserves in an area prior to constructing facilities in that area. To the extent we rely on estimates of future production in our decision to construct additions to our systems, such estimates may prove to be inaccurate as a result of the numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of future production. As a result, new facilities may not attract enough throughput to achieve our expected investment return, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">In addition, the construction of additions to our existing gathering and transportation assets may require us to obtain new rights-of-way. We may be unable to obtain such rights-of-way and may, therefore, be unable to connect new natural gas volumes to our systems or capitalize on other attractive expansion opportunities. Additionally, it may become more expensive for us to obtain new rights-of-way or to renew existing rights- of-way. If the cost of renewing or obtaining new rights-of-way increases materially, our cash flows could be adversely affected.</p><h4 style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 71%;text-align: justify;">We do not intend to obtain independent evaluations of natural gas reserves connected to our gathering and transportation systems on a regular or ongoing basis; therefore, in the future, volumes of natural gas on our systems could be less than we anticipate.</h4><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">We do not intend to obtain independent evaluations of natural gas reserves connected to our systems on a regular or ongoing basis. Accordingly, we may not have independent estimates of total reserves dedicated to some or all of our systems or the anticipated life of such reserves. If the total reserves or estimated life of the reserves connected to our gathering and transportation systems are less than we anticipate and we are unable to secure additional sources of natural gas, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and our ability to make cash distributions to our unitholders.</p><h4 style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 71%;text-align: justify;">Our business involves many hazards and operational risks, some of which may not be fully covered by insurance. If a significant accident or event occurs for which we are not adequately insured, our operations and financial results could be adversely affected.</h4><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Our operations are subject to all of the risks and hazards inherent in the gathering, compressing, treating, processing and transportation of natural gas, including:</p></li><li style="padding-left: 37pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">damage to pipelines and plants, related equipment and surrounding properties caused by hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, fires and other natural disasters and acts of terrorism;</p></li><li style="padding-left: 37pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">inadvertent damage from construction, vehicles, farm and utility equipment;</p></li><li style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 37pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">leaks of natural gas and other hydrocarbons or losses of natural gas as a result of the malfunction of equipment or facilities;</p></li><li style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 37pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">ruptures, fires and explosions; and</p></li><li style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 37pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">other hazards that could also result in personal injury and loss of life, pollution and suspension of operations.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">For example, in April 2010, there was a rupture in our Bazor Ridge gathering pipeline which gathers natural gas high in hydrogen sulfide content which resulted in an extended shut-down of a significant portion of that system until the pipeline could be inspected and repaired. The affected portion of the line is the one that gathered the most significant volumes of gas on this system and delivered it to our Bazor Ridge plant, and we were required to curtail a portion of this flow volume until we built a new bypass pipeline, the Winchester Lateral, connecting this production, as well as potential new production, to the Bazor Ridge plant. The affected section of line was fully shut down for approximately 25 days and, until our Winchester Lateral was completed approximately 177 days later, we were able to gather only approximately 70% of pre-rupture flow volume. The Winchester Lateral cost $3.9 million to construct and the repairs to, and testing of the affected sections of pipe cost approximately</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">$0.5 million.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">These risks could result in substantial losses due to personal injury and/or loss of life, severe damage to and destruction of property and equipment and pollution or other environmental damage. These risks may also result in curtailment or suspension of our operations. A natural disaster or other hazard affecting the areas in which we operate could have a material adverse effect on our operations. We are not fully insured against all risks inherent in our business. For example, we do not have any casualty insurance on our underground pipeline systems that would cover damage to the pipelines. Additionally, we do not have business interruption/loss of income insurance that would provide coverage in the event of damage to any of our underground facilities. In addition,</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">31</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 2pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="776" height="2" alt="image" src="NYSE_AMID_2012/Image_044.png"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">although we are insured for environmental pollution resulting from environmental accidents that occur on a sudden and accidental basis, we may not be insured against all environmental accidents that might occur, some of which may result in toxic tort claims. If a significant accident or event occurs for which we are not fully insured, it could adversely affect our operations and financial condition. Furthermore, we may not be able to maintain or obtain insurance of the type and amount we desire at reasonable rates. As a result of market conditions, premiums and deductibles for certain of our insurance policies may substantially increase. In some instances, certain insurance could become unavailable or available only for reduced amounts of coverage. Additionally, we may be unable to recover from prior owners of our assets, pursuant to our indemnification rights, for potential environmental liabilities.</p><h4 style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 71%;text-align: justify;">Our interstate natural gas pipelines are subject to regulation by the FERC, which could adversely affect our ability to make distributions to our unitholders.</h4><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Our AlaTenn and Midla interstate natural gas transportation systems are subject to regulation by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (“FERC”), under the Natural Gas Act of 1938 (“NGA”). Under the NGA, the rates for and terms of conditions of service on these interstate facilities must be just and reasonable and not unduly discriminatory. The rates and terms and conditions for our interstate pipeline services are set forth in tariffs that must be filed with and approved by the FERC. Pursuant to the FERC’s jurisdiction over rates, existing rates may be challenged by complaint and proposed rate increases may be challenged by protest. Any successful complaint or protest against our rates could have an adverse impact on our revenue associated with providing transportation service.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Under the NGA, the FERC has the authority to regulate companies that provide natural gas pipeline transportation services in interstate commerce. The FERC’s authority over such companies includes such matters as:</p></li><li style="padding-left: 37pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">rates and terms and conditions of service;</p></li><li style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 37pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">the types of services interstate pipelines may offer to their customers;</p></li><li style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 37pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">the certification and construction of new facilities;</p></li><li style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 37pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">the acquisition, extension, disposition or abandonment of facilities;</p></li><li style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 37pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">the maintenance of accounts and records;</p></li><li style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 37pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">relationships between affiliated companies involved in certain aspects of the natural gas business;</p></li><li style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 37pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">the initiation and discontinuation of services;</p></li><li style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 37pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">market manipulation in connection with interstate sales, purchases or transportation of natural gas and NGLs; and</p></li><li style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 37pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">participation by interstate pipelines in cash management arrangements.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The Energy Policy Act of 2005 amended the NGA to add an anti-manipulation provision. Pursuant to the amended NGA, the FERC established rules prohibiting energy market manipulation. Also, the FERC’s rules require interstate pipelines and their affiliates to adhere to Standards of Conduct that, among other things, require that transportation employees function independently of marketing employees. The FERC also requires interstate pipelines to adhere to its rules regarding the filing and approval of transportation agreements that include provisions which differ from the transportation agreements included in their FERC gas tariff. We are conducting a review of the transportation agreements entered into by our predecessor to determine whether, and to what extent, any of our transportation agreements include such provisions. We are subject to audit by the FERC of our compliance in general, including adherence to all its rules and regulations. A violation of these rules, or any other rules, regulations or orders issued or administered by the FERC, may subject us to civil penalties, disgorgement of unjust profits, or appropriate non-monetary remedies imposed by the FERC. In addition, the Energy Policy Act of 2005 amended the NGA and the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978 (“NGPA”), to increase civil and criminal penalties for any violation of the NGA, NGPA and any rules, regulations or orders of the FERC up to $1.0 million per day per violation.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Additionally, existing rates may not reflect our current costs of operations, which may have risen since the last time our rates were approved by the FERC. Because proposed rate increases are procedurally complicated, we may have a significant period of time during which our gross margin from such FERC-regulated systems may be materially less than we have historically obtained.</p><h4 style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Our new pipeline and related assets acquired through High Point Infrastructure Partners are subject to additional orders from the FERC.</h4><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The pipeline and related assets that we acquired from High Point on April 15, 2013 are owned by two of our subsidiaries, High Point Gas Transmission, LLC (“HPGT”) and High Point Gas Gathering, LLC (“HPGG”). In an order issued in June 2012, the FERC approved the abandonment of these mainly offshore assets by Southern Natural Gas Company, L.L.C (“Southern Natural”) to allow for their transfer to HPGT. The FERC determined that some of these assets constitute gathering facilities that are generally exempt from FERC regulation under the Natural Gas Act. FERC&#39;s June 21, 2012 order also authorizes HPGT to own and operate the jurisdictional assets, specifically the assets that are used for interstate transmission of natural gas. Following its acquisition of the assets from Southern Natural, HPGT transferred the exempt gathering assets to HPGG. Several shippers who protested Southern Natural&#39;s application to abandon these assets and HPGT&#39;s application to own and operate these assets have sought</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">32</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="776" height="2" alt="image" src="NYSE_AMID_2012/Image_045.png"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">rehearing of the FERC&#39;s June 2012 order approving the applications. The shippers who are gas producers whose production is gathered by these assets are complaining to the FERC that the transfer should not have been authorized because the effect has been to result in additional charges for the use of the facilities to deliver gas to Southern Natural at a point onshore. They also are alleging that Southern Natural had no FERC authorization to transfer the exempt gathering facilities to HPGG, but only to HPGT.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Notwithstanding the rehearing request, the FERC&#39;s June 2012 order is fully effective. Although the producers might have asked FERC to stay its order, they did not do so. As authorized by the June 2012 order, Southern Natural abandoned the facilities and transferred them to HPGT, which then transferred the exempt gathering facilities to HPGG. (Southern Natural did not transfer the facilities directly to HPGT.) While the shipper&#39;s request for rehearing asked FERC to disapprove the original abandonment by Southern Natural, the shippers did not seek any other relief as to HPGT&#39;s authority to own and operate the assets or FERC&#39;s authority to unwind the transfers at that time. Subsequently, after the statutory deadline for such requests, shippers sought to void HPGT&#39;s authorization to own and operate the assets and to unwind the transaction; however, the Company believes these requests are time-barred. The shipper&#39;s requests for rehearing of the June 2012 order and subsequent requests remain pending. It is not known whether FERC will change its original decision, or whether the shippers will appeal the FERC&#39;s order to the courts if their requests are denied. While we consider any adverse outcome unlikely, an adverse result could have a materially adverse effect on our financial condition.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">In a separate proceeding, HPGT filed with FERC initial rates for interstate gas transportation service in compliance with the FERC&#39;s June 2012 order. In an order issued in September 2012, the FERC allowed HPGT to collect its proposed rates starting as of November 1, 2012, the date that HPGT acquired the assets from Southern Natural; however the collection of rates is “subject to refund” and a final ruling by the FERC on the rates and on the requests for rehearing. The shippers have protested HPGT&#39;s initial rates, alleging that they are excessive because, among other reasons, HPGT did not allocate enough costs to the gathering service rates. As a result of information requests from the FERC&#39;s staff, HPGT has filed additional rate calculations using different allocation methods as requested. The shipper protests remain pending. We believe that our initial rates are just and reasonable, however, should the FERC determine that the shippers are owed a refund, it could have a materially adverse effect on our financial condition.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">A standard requirement in the June 2012 FERC order is that HPGT file, in three years, a cost and revenue study based on a recent 12-month period. The FERC will review the study and determine whether it believes HPGT is collecting excessive revenue. Although the results of the cost/revenue study are uncertain at this early stage, if the FERC were to conclude that HPGT had been collecting excess revenue, it could initiate a rate proceeding to require HPGT to determine whether its rates should be lowered prospectively. If the initial rates are determined to be too low and not sufficient to enable HPGT to cover its costs, HPGT would have the option to file at any time for a prospective rate increase. Although we believe that HPGT&#39;s rates are just and reasonable, we are unable to predict the likelihood that the FERC will conclude, based on HPGT&#39;s  filing in three years, that HPGT&#39;s rates  resulted in the collection of excess  revenue and that HPGT&#39;s rates  should be reduced prospectively, and if such efforts are successful the amount of any such rate reduction.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 71%;text-align: justify;">The application of certain FERC policy statements could affect the rate of return on our equity we are allowed to recover through rates and the amount of any allowance (if any) our interstate systems can include for income taxes in establishing their rates for service, which would in turn impact our revenue and/or equity earnings.</h4><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">In setting authorized rates of return for interstate natural gas pipelines, the FERC uses a discounted cash flow model that incorporates the use of proxy groups to develop a range of reasonable returns earned on equity interests in companies with corresponding risks. The FERC then assigns a rate of return on equity within that range to reflect specific risks of that pipeline when compared to the proxy group companies. The FERC allows master limited partnerships (“MLPs”), to be included in the proxy group to determine return on equity. However, as to such MLPs, the FERC will generally adjust the long-term growth rate used to calculate the equity cost of capital. The FERC stated that the long-term growth projection for natural gas pipeline MLPs will be equal to fifty percent of gross domestic product (“GDP”), as compared to the unadjusted GDP used for corporations. Therefore, to the extent that MLPs are included in a proxy group, the FERC’s policy lowers the return on equity that might otherwise be allowed if there were no adjustment to the MLP growth projection used for the discounted cash flow model. This could lower the return on equity that we would otherwise be able to obtain.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The FERC currently allows partnerships, including MLPs, to include in their cost-of-service an income tax allowance if the partnership’s owners have actual or potential income tax liability, a matter that will be reviewed by the FERC on a case-by-case basis. Any changes to the FERC’s treatment of income tax allowances in cost-of-service rates or an adverse determination with respect to the inclusion of an income tax allowance in our interstate pipelines’ rates could result in an adjustment in a future rate case of our interstate pipelines’ respective equity rates of return that underlie their recourse rates and may cause their recourse rates to be set at a level that is different, and in some instances lower, than the level otherwise in effect.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">33</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="776" height="2" alt="image" src="NYSE_AMID_2012/Image_046.png"/></span></p><h4 style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 70%;text-align: justify;">A change in the jurisdictional characterization or regulation of our assets by federal, state or local regulatory agencies or a change in policy by those agencies could result in increased regulation of our assets which could materially and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.</h4><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Intrastate transportation facilities that do not provide interstate transmission services are exempt from the jurisdiction of the FERC under the NGA. Although the FERC has not made any formal determinations with respect to any of our facilities, we believe that our intrastate natural gas pipelines and related facilities that are not engaged in providing interstate transmission services are engaged in exempt gathering and intrastate transportation and, therefore, are not subject to FERC jurisdiction. We believe that our natural gas gathering pipelines meet the traditional tests that the FERC has used to determine if a pipeline is a gathering pipeline and is therefore not subject to the FERC’s jurisdiction. The distinction between FERC-regulated transmission services and federally unregulated gathering services is the subject of substantial ongoing litigation and, over time, the FERC’s policy for determining which facilities it regulates has changed. In addition, the distinction between FERC-regulated transmission facilities, on the one hand, and intrastate transportation and gathering facilities, on the other, is a fact-based determination made by the FERC on a case by case basis. If the FERC were to consider the status of an individual facility and determine that the facility and/or services provided by it are not exempt from FERC regulation under the NGA, the rates for, and terms and conditions of, services provided by such facility would be subject to regulation by the FERC under the NGA. Such regulation could decrease revenue, increase operating costs, and, depending upon the facility in question, could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows. In addition, if any of our facilities were found to have provided services or otherwise operated in violation of the NGA or NGPA, this could result in the imposition of civil penalties as well as a requirement to disgorge charges collected for such service in excess of the cost-based rate established by the FERC.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Moreover, FERC regulation affects our gathering, transportation and compression business generally. The FERC’s policies and practices across the range of its natural gas regulatory activities, including, for example, its policies on open access transportation, market manipulation, ratemaking, capacity release and market transparency and market center promotion, directly and indirectly affect our gathering business. In addition, the classification and regulation of our gathering and intrastate transportation facilities also are subject to change based on future determinations by the FERC, the courts or Congress.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">State regulation of gathering facilities generally includes various safety, environmental and, in some circumstances, nondiscriminatory take requirements and complaint-based rate regulation. In recent years, the FERC has taken a more light-handed approach to regulation of the gathering activities of interstate pipeline transmission companies, which has resulted in a number of these companies transferring gathering facilities to federally unregulated affiliates. As a result of these activities, natural gas gathering may begin to receive greater regulatory scrutiny at both the state and federal levels.</p><h4 style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">We are subject to stringent environmental laws and regulations that may expose us to significant costs and liabilities.</h4><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Our natural gas gathering, compression, treating and transportation operations are subject to stringent and complex federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations that govern the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relate to environmental protection. Examples of these laws include:</p></li><li style="padding-left: 37pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">the federal Clean Air Act and analogous state laws that impose obligations related to air emissions;</p></li><li style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 37pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;"><p style="display: inline;">the federal  Comprehensive Environmental  Response, Compensation and Liability Act  (“CERCLA” or the “Superfund law”), and analogous state laws that regulate the cleanup of hazardous substances that may be or have been released at properties currently or previously owned or operated by us or at locations to which our wastes are or have been transported for disposal;</p></li><li style="padding-left: 37pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">the federal Water Pollution Control Act (“Clean Water Act”), and analogous state laws that regulate discharges from our facilities into state and federal waters, including wetlands;</p></li><li style="padding-left: 37pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">the federal Oil Pollution Act (“OPA”), and analogous state laws that establish strict liability for releases of oil into waters of the United States;</p></li><li style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 37pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">the federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (“RCRA”), and analogous state laws that impose requirements for the storage, treatment and disposal of solid and hazardous waste from our facilities;</p></li><li style="padding-left: 37pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">the Endangered Species Act (“ESA”); and</p></li><li style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 37pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">the Toxic Substances Control Act (“TSCA”), and analogous state laws that impose requirements on the use, storage and disposal of various chemicals and chemical substances at our facilities.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">These laws and regulations may impose numerous obligations that are applicable to our operations, including the acquisition of permits to conduct regulated activities, the incurrence of capital or operating expenditures to limit or prevent releases of materials from our pipelines and facilities, and the imposition of substantial liabilities and remedial obligations for pollution resulting from our operations. Numerous governmental authorities, such as the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”), and analogous state agencies, have the power to enforce compliance with these laws and regulations and the permits issued under them, oftentimes requiring difficult and costly corrective actions. Failure to comply with these laws, regulations and permits may result in the assessment of administrative, civil and criminal penalties, the imposition of remedial obligations and the issuance of injunctions</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">34</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="776" height="2" alt="image" src="NYSE_AMID_2012/Image_047.png"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">limiting or preventing some or all of our operations. For example, with respect to our Bazor Ridge system, in the course of preparing our annual MDEQ filing for 2010 as required by our Title V Air Permit, we determined that we underreported to MDEQ the SO <span class="s10">2 </span>emissions from the Bazor Ridge plant for 2009 and 2010. Moreover, we discovered that SO <span class="s10">2 </span>emission levels during 2009 may have exceeded the threshold that triggers the need for a Prevention of Significant Deterioration (“PSD”), permit under the federal Clean Air Act. No PSD permit has been issued for the Bazor Ridge plant. In addition, we recently determined that certain SO <span class="s10">2 </span>emissions during 2009 and 2010 exceeded the reportable quantity threshold under the federal Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (“EPCRA”), requiring notification of various governmental authorities. We did not make any such EPCRA notifications. In July 2011, we self-reported these issues to the MDEQ and EPA Region IV. In January 2012, we met with EPA Region IV representatives, and have agreed to a settlement with respect to the EPCRA reporting issue. A Consent Agreement and Final Order was executed, which included a civil penalty of $23,010 . After discussion with the MDEQ, in <span class="s26">February 2012 we submitted an application to amend our Title V Air Permit to account for these SO </span><span class="s27">2 </span><span class="s26">emissions. The MDEQ has processed this </span>permit application. In December 2011, EPA Region IV performed an inspection of the plant, and they followed up with an Information Request in May 2012. We have responded to this Information Request and do not anticipate any further action required by the Partnership at this time.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">On March 11, 2013, the Environmental Protection Agency issued a Clean Air Act Compliance Order related to an inspection of the Chatom processing plant on May 15, 2012. The order was issued to Quantum Resources Management, LLC, the owner at the time of the inspection. EPA has requested information regarding releases identified during the inspection, including a description of the equipment and repairs that were performed. We will timely respond to this request. At this time, we cannot determine whether EPA may pursue further enforcement related to these releases and cannot predict the amount of any potential fines or penalties.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Please read “Business — Environmental Matters — Air Emissions” for more information about these matters. In addition, we may experience a delay in obtaining or be unable to obtain required permits, which may cause us to lose potential and current customers, interrupt our operations and limit our growth and revenue.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">There is a risk that we may incur significant environmental costs and liabilities in connection with our operations due to historical industry operations and waste disposal practices, our handling of hydrocarbon wastes and potential emissions and discharges related to our operations. Joint and several, strict liability may be incurred, without regard to fault, under certain of these environmental laws and regulations in connection with discharges or releases of hydrocarbon wastes on, under or from our properties and facilities, many of which have been used for midstream activities for a number of years, oftentimes by third parties not under our control. Private parties, including the owners of the properties through which our gathering or transportation systems pass and facilities where our wastes are taken for reclamation or disposal, may also have the right to pursue legal actions to enforce compliance as well as to seek damages for non-compliance with environmental laws and regulations or for personal injury or property damage. For example, an accidental release from one of our pipelines could subject us to substantial liabilities arising from environmental cleanup and restoration costs, claims made by neighboring landowners and other third parties for personal injury and property damage and fines or penalties for related violations of environmental laws or regulations. In addition, changes in environmental laws occur frequently, and any such changes that result in more stringent and costly waste handling, storage, transport, disposal or remediation requirements could have a material adverse effect on our operations or financial position. We may not be able to recover all or any of these costs from insurance. Please read “Business — Environmental Matters” for more information.</p><h4 style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Our operations may impact the environment or cause environmental contamination, which could result in material liabilities to us.</h4><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Our operations use hazardous materials, generate limited quantities of hazardous wastes and may affect runoff or drainage water. In the event of environmental contamination or a release of hazardous materials, we could become subject to claims for toxic torts, natural resource damages and other damages and for the investigation and cleanup of soil, surface water, groundwater, and other media. Such claims may arise out of conditions at sites that we currently own or operate, as well as at sites that we previously owned or operated, or may acquire. Our liability for such claims may be joint and several, so that we may be held responsible for more than our share of the contamination or other damages, or even for the entire share. These and other impacts that our operations may have on the environment, as well as exposures to hazardous substances or wastes associated with our operations, could result in costs  and liabilities  that could have a material  adverse effect  on us.

The American Clean Energy and Security Act of 2009, passed by the House of Representatives, would, if enacted by the full Congress, have required greenhouse gas</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">35</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="776" height="2" alt="image" src="NYSE_AMID_2012/Image_048.png"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">(“GHG”), emissions reductions by covered sources of as much as 17% from 2005 levels by 2020 and by as much as 83% by 2050. It presently appears unlikely that comprehensive climate legislation will be passed by either house of Congress in the near future, although energy legislation and other initiatives are expected to be proposed that may be relevant to GHG emissions issues. In addition, almost half of the states, either individually or through multi-state regional initiatives, have begun to address GHG emissions, primarily through the planned development of emission inventories or regional GHG cap and trade programs. Most of these cap and trade programs work by requiring either major sources of emissions, such as electric power plants, or major producers of fuels, such as refineries and gas processing plants, to acquire and surrender emission allowances. The number of allowances available for purchase is reduced each year until the overall GHG emission reduction goal is achieved. Depending on the scope of a particular program, we could be required to purchase and surrender allowances for GHG emissions resulting from our operations (e.g., at compressor stations). Although most of the state-level initiatives have to date been focused on large sources of GHG emissions, such as electric power plants, it is possible that smaller sources such as our gas-fired compressors could become subject to GHG-related regulation. Depending on the particular program, we could be required to control emissions or to purchase and surrender allowances for GHG emissions resulting from our operations.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Independent of Congress, the EPA is beginning to adopt regulations controlling GHG emissions under its existing Clean Air Act authority. For example, on December 15, 2009, the EPA officially published its findings that emissions of carbon dioxide, methane and other GHGs present an endangerment to human health and the environment because emissions of such gases are, according to the EPA, contributing to warming of the earth’s atmosphere and other climatic changes. These findings by the EPA allow the agency to proceed with the adoption and implementation of regulations that would restrict emissions of greenhouse gases under existing provisions of the federal Clean Air Act. In 2009, the EPA adopted rules regarding regulation of GHG emissions from motor vehicles. In addition, on September 22, 2009, the EPA issued a final rule requiring the reporting of greenhouse gas emissions from specified large greenhouse gas emission sources in the U.S. beginning in 2011 for emissions occurring in 2010. Our Bazor Ridge facility is currently required to report under this rule beginning in 2011. On November 30, 2010, the EPA published a final rule expanding its existing GHG emissions reporting rule for petroleum and natural gas facilities, including natural gas transmission compression facilities that emit 25,000 metric tons or more of carbon dioxide equivalent per year. The rule, which went into effect on December 30, 2010, requires reporting of greenhouse gas emissions by regulated facilities to the EPA by March 2012 for emissions during 2011 and annually thereafter. We filed emission reports for our Bazor Ridge and Chatom systems in March 2012. In 2010, the EPA also issued a final rule, known as the “Tailoring Rule,” that makes certain large stationary sources and modification projects subject to permitting requirements for greenhouse gas emissions under the Clean Air Act.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">On August 16, 2012, the EPA published final rules that establish new air emission controls for natural gas processing operations. Specifically, the EPA’s rule package includes New Source Performance Standards (&quot;NSPS&quot;) to address emissions of sulfur dioxide and volatile organic compounds (“VOCs”), and a separate set of emission standards to address hazardous air pollutants frequently associated with natural gas processing activities. The rules establish specific requirements regarding emissions from compressors, dehydrators, storage tanks and other production equipment. In addition, the rules establish new leak detection requirements for natural gas processing plants. Under these rules we are required to modify some of our operations, though we do not expect these modifications to have a material effect on our operations. Following the publication of the final rule, EPA received petitions for reconsideration of certain aspects of the standards. On April 12, 2013, EPA published proposed updates to the NSPS Section OOOO storage tank requirements.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">EPA could develop new rules and current rules may be modified.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Although it is not possible at this time to accurately estimate how potential future laws or regulations addressing greenhouse gas emissions would impact our business, any future federal laws or implementing regulations that may be adopted to address greenhouse gas emissions could require us to incur increased operating costs and could adversely affect demand for the natural gas we gather, treat or otherwise handle in connection with our services. The potential increase in the costs of our operations resulting from any legislation or regulation to restrict emissions of greenhouse gases could include new or increased costs to operate and maintain our facilities, install new emission controls on our facilities, acquire allowances to authorize our greenhouse gas emissions, pay any taxes related to our greenhouse gas emissions and administer and manage a greenhouse gas emissions program. While we may be able to include some or all of such increased costs in the rates charged by our pipelines or other facilities, such recovery of costs is uncertain. Moreover, incentives to conserve energy or use alternative energy sources could reduce demand for natural gas, resulting in a decrease in demand for our services. We cannot predict with any certainty at this time how these possibilities may affect our operations.</p><h4 style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Our pipelines may become subject to more stringent safety regulation.</h4><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The Pipeline Safety, Regulatory Certainty, and Job Creation Act of 2011, which became law in January 2012, increases the penalties for safety violations, establishes additional safety requirements for newly constructed pipelines and requires studies of safety issues that could result in the adoption of new regulatory requirements  for existing pipelines. The Department of Transportation (“DOT”), has  also recently proposed legislation providing for more stringent oversight of pipelines and increased penalties for</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">36</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="776" height="2" alt="image" src="NYSE_AMID_2012/Image_049.png"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">violations of safety rules, which is in addition to the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration’s announced intention to strengthen its rules. The Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (“PHMSA”), which is part of DOT, recently issued a final rule, effective October 1, 2011, applying safety regulations to certain rural low-stress hazardous liquid pipelines that were not covered previously by some of its safety regulations. We believe that this rule does not apply to any of our pipelines. While we cannot predict the outcome of other proposed legislative or regulatory initiatives, such legislative and regulatory changes could have a material effect on our operations particularly by extending more stringent and comprehensive safety regulations (such as integrity management requirements) to pipelines not previously subject to such requirements. Additionally, legislative and regulatory changes may also result in higher penalties for the violation of federal pipeline safety regulations. While we expect any legislative or regulatory changes to allow us time to become compliant with new requirements, costs associated with compliance may have a material effect on our operations. We cannot predict with any certainty at this time the terms of any new laws or rules or the costs of compliance associated with such requirements.</p><h4 style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 71%;text-align: justify;">The adoption and implementation of new statutory and regulatory requirements for swap transactions could have an adverse impact on our ability to hedge risks associated with our business and increase the working capital requirements to conduct these activities.</h4><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">In July 2010 federal legislation known as the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (“Dodd-Frank Act”) was enacted. The Dodd-Frank Act provides new statutory requirements for swap transactions, including oil and gas hedging transactions. These statutory requirements must be implemented through regulation primarily through rules to be adopted by the Commodities Futures Trading Commission (“CFTC”). The Dodd-Frank Act provisions are intended to change fundamentally the way swap transactions are entered into, transforming an over-the-counter market in which parties negotiate directly with each other into a regulated market in which most swaps are to be executed on registered exchanges or swap execution facilities and cleared through central counterparties. Many market participants will be newly regulated as swap dealers or major swap participants, with new regulatory capital requirements and other regulations that may impose business conduct rules and mandate how they hold collateral or margin for swap transactions. All market participants will be subject to new reporting and recordkeeping requirements.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The impact of the Dodd-Frank Act on our hedging activities is uncertain at this time, and the CFTC has not yet promulgated final regulations implementing the key provisions. Although we do not believe we will need to register as a swap dealer or major swap participant, and do not believe we will be subject to the new requirements to trade on an exchange or swap execution facility or to clear swaps through a central counterparty, we may have new regulatory burdens. Moreover, the changes to the swap market as a result of Dodd-Frank implementation could significantly increase the cost of entering into new swaps or maintaining existing swaps, materially alter the terms of new or existing swap transactions and/or reduce the availability of new or existing swaps.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Depending on the rules and definitions adopted by the CFTC, we might in the future be required to provide cash collateral for our commodities hedging transactions under circumstances in which we do not currently post cash collateral. Posting of such additional cash collateral could impact liquidity and reduce our cash available for capital expenditures or other partnership purposes. A requirement to post cash collateral could therefore reduce our willingness or ability to execute hedges to reduce commodity price uncertainty and thus protect cash flows.

We obtain the rights to construct and operate our pipelines on land owned by third parties and governmental agencies for a specific period of time.

The provisions of our June 2012 amended credit facility affect our ability to obtain future financing and pursue attractive business opportunities and our flexibility in planning for, and reacting to, changes in business conditions. In addition, a failure to comply with the provisions of our June 2012 amended credit facility could result in a default or an event of default that could enable our lenders to declare the outstanding principal of that debt, together with accrued and unpaid interest, to be immediately due and payable. If the payment of our debt is accelerated, our assets may be insufficient to repay such debt in full, and our unitholders could experience a partial or total loss of their investment.</p><h4 style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Debt we incur in the future may limit our flexibility to obtain financing and to pursue other business opportunities.</h4><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Our future level of debt could have important consequences to us, including the following:</p></li><li style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 37pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">our ability to obtain additional financing, if necessary, for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other purposes may be impaired or such financing may not be available on favorable terms;</p></li><li style="padding-left: 37pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">our funds available for operations, future business opportunities and distributions to unitholders will be reduced by that portion of our cash flow required to make interest payments on our debt;</p></li><li style="padding-left: 37pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">we may be more vulnerable to competitive pressures or a downturn in our business or the economy generally; and</p></li><li style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 37pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">our flexibility in responding to changing business and economic conditions may be limited.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Our ability to service our debt will depend upon, among other things, our future financial and operating performance, which will be affected by prevailing economic conditions and financial, business, regulatory and other factors, some of which are beyond our control. If our operating results are not sufficient to service any future indebtedness, we will be forced to take actions such as reducing distributions, reducing or delaying our business activities, acquisitions, investments or capital expenditures, selling assets or seeking additional equity capital. We may not be able to affect any of these actions on satisfactory terms or at all.</p><h4 style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 71%;text-align: justify;">As our common units are yield-oriented securities, increases in interest rates could adversely impact our unit price, our ability to issue equity or incur debt for acquisitions or other purposes and our ability to make cash distributions at our intended levels.</h4><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Interest rates may increase in the future. As a result, interest rates on future credit facilities and debt offerings could be higher than current levels, causing our financing costs to increase accordingly. As with other yield-oriented securities, our unit price is impacted by our level of our cash distributions and implied distribution yield. The distribution yield is often used by investors to compare and rank yield-oriented securities for investment decision-making purposes. Therefore, changes in interest rates, either positive or negative, may affect the yield requirements of investors who invest in our units, and a rising interest rate environment could have an adverse impact on our unit price, our ability to issue equity or incur debt for acquisitions or other purposes and our ability to make cash distributions at our intended levels.</p><h4 style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 71%;text-align: justify;">We currently have a small management team, and our ability to operate our business effectively could be impaired if we fail to attract and retain key management personnel.</h4><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">We currently have a small management team, and our ability to operate our business and implement our strategies depends on the continued contributions of certain executive officers and key employees of our general partner. Our general partner has a smaller managerial, operational and financial staff than many of the companies in our industry. Given the small size of our management team, the loss of any one member of our management team could have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, certain of our field operating managers are approaching retirement age. We believe that our future success will depend on our continued ability to attract and retain highly skilled management personnel with midstream natural gas industry experience and competition for these persons in the midstream natural gas industry is intense. Given our small size, we may be at a disadvantage, relative to our larger competitors, in the competition for these personnel. We may not be able to continue to employ our senior executives and key personnel or attract and retain qualified personnel in the future, and our failure to retain or attract our senior executives and key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our ability to effectively operate our business.</p><h4 style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 71%;text-align: justify;">A shortage of skilled labor in the midstream natural gas industry could reduce labor productivity and increase costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.</h4><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The gathering, treating, processing and transporting of natural gas requires skilled laborers in multiple disciplines such as equipment operators, mechanics and engineers, among others. We have from time to time encountered shortages for these types of skilled labor. If we experience shortages of skilled labor in the future, our labor and overall productivity or costs could be materially and adversely affected. If our labor prices increase or if we experience materially increased health and benefit costs with respect to our general partner’s employees, our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.</p><h4 style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 71%;text-align: justify;">Our work force could become unionized in the future, which could adversely affect the stability of our production and materially reduce our profitability.</h4><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">38</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="776" height="2" alt="image" src="NYSE_AMID_2012/Image_051.png"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">All of our systems are operated by non-union employees of our general partner. Our employees have the right at any time under the National Labor Relations Act to form or affiliate with a union. If our employees choose to form or affiliate with a union and the terms of a union collective bargaining agreement are significantly different from our current compensation and job assignment arrangements with our employees, these arrangements could adversely affect the stability of our operations and materially reduce our profitability.</p><h4 style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 71%;text-align: justify;">A failure in our operational systems or cyber security attacks on any of our facilities, or those of third parties, may affect adversely our financial results.</h4><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Our business is dependent upon our operational systems to process a large amount of data and complex transactions. If any of our financial, operational, or other data processing systems fail or have other significant shortcomings, our financial results could be adversely affected. Our financial results could also be adversely affected if an employee causes our operational systems to fail, either as a result of inadvertent error or by deliberately tampering with or manipulating our operational systems. In addition, dependence upon automated systems may further increase the risk that operational system flaws, employee tampering or manipulation of those systems will result in losses that are difficult to detect.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Due to increased technology advances, we have become more reliant on technology to help increase efficiency in our business. We use computer programs to help run our financial and operational departments, and this may subject our business to increased risks. Any future cyber security attacks that affect our facilities, our customers and any financial data could have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, cyber- attacks on our customer and employee data may result in financial loss and may negatively impact our reputation. Third-party systems on which we rely could also suffer operational system failure. Any of these occurrences could disrupt our business, result in potential liability or reputational damage or otherwise have an adverse effect on our financial results.</p><h4 style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 71%;text-align: justify;">The amount of cash we have available for distribution to holders of our common and subordinated units depends primarily on our cash flow rather than on our profitability, which may prevent us from making distributions, even during periods in which we record net income.</h4><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The amount of cash we have available for distribution depends primarily upon our cash flow and not solely on profitability, which will be affected by non-cash items.

Our general partner may therefore cause us to incur indebtedness or other obligations that are nonrecourse to our general partner. Our partnership agreement provides that any action taken by our general partner to limit its liability is not a breach of our general partner’s fiduciary duties, even if we could have obtained more favorable terms without the limitation on liability. In addition, we are obligated to reimburse or indemnify our general partner to the extent that it incurs obligations on our behalf. Any such reimbursement or indemnification payments would reduce the amount of cash otherwise available for distribution to our unitholders.</p><h4 style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Our partnership agreement requires that we distribute all of our available cash, which could limit our ability to grow and make acquisitions.</h4><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">We distribute all of our available cash to our unitholders and will rely primarily upon external financing sources, including commercial bank borrowings and the issuance of debt and equity securities, to fund our acquisitions and expansion capital expenditures. As a result, to the extent we are unable to finance growth externally, our cash distribution policy will significantly impair our ability to grow. In addition, because we distribute all of our available cash, we may not grow as quickly as businesses that reinvest their available cash to expand ongoing operations. To the extent we issue additional units in connection with any acquisitions or expansion capital expenditures, the payment of distributions on those additional units may increase the risk that we will be unable to maintain or increase our per unit distribution level. There are no limitations in our partnership agreement, and in our June 2012 amended credit facility, on our ability to issue additional units, including units ranking senior to the common units. The incurrence of additional commercial borrowings or other debt to finance our growth strategy would result in increased interest expense, which, in turn, may impact the available cash that we have to distribute to our unitholders.</p><h4 style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Our partnership agreement limits our general partner’s fiduciary duties to holders of our common and subordinated units.</h4><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Our partnership agreement contains provisions that modify and reduce the fiduciary standards to which our general partner would otherwise be held by state fiduciary duty law. For example, our partnership agreement permits our general partner to make a number of decisions in its individual capacity, as opposed to in its capacity as our general partner or otherwise, free of fiduciary duties to us and our unitholders. This entitles our general partner to consider only the interests and factors that it desires and relieves it of any duty or obligation to give any consideration to any interest of, or factors affecting, us, our affiliates or our limited partners.

If an affiliate transaction or the resolution of a conflict of interest is not approved by our common unitholders or the conflicts committee and the board of directors of our general partner determines that the resolution or course of action taken with respect to the affiliate transaction or conflict of interest satisfies either of the standards set forth in subclauses (c) and (d) above, then it will be presumed that, in making its decision, the board of directors acted in good faith, and in any proceeding brought by or on behalf of any limited partner or the partnership, the person bringing or prosecuting such proceeding will have the burden of overcoming such presumption.</p><h4 style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 71%;text-align: justify;">Our general partner may elect to cause us to issue common units to it in connection with a resetting of the target distribution levels related to our general partner’s incentive distribution rights without the approval of the conflicts committee of our general partner’s board or our unitholders. This election may result in lower distributions to our common unitholders in certain situations.</h4><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Our general partner has the right, at any time when there are no subordinated units outstanding and it has received incentive distributions at the highest level to which it is entitled (48.0%) for each of the prior four consecutive fiscal quarters, to reset the initial target distribution levels at higher levels based on our cash distribution at the time of the exercise of the reset election. Following a reset election by our general partner, the minimum quarterly distribution will be reset to an amount equal to the average cash distribution per unit for the two fiscal quarters immediately preceding the reset election (such amount is referred to as the “reset minimum quarterly distribution”), and the target distribution levels will be reset to correspondingly higher levels based on percentage increases above the reset minimum quarterly distribution.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">We anticipate that our general partner would exercise this reset right in order to facilitate acquisitions or internal growth projects that would not be sufficiently accretive to cash distributions per common unit without such conversion; however, it is possible that our general partner could exercise this reset election at a time when we are experiencing declines in our aggregate cash distributions or at a time when our general partner expects that we will experience declines in our aggregate cash distributions in the foreseeable future. In such situations, our general partner may be experiencing, or may expect to experience, declines in the cash distributions it receives related to its incentive distribution rights and may therefore desire to be issued common units, which are entitled to specified priorities with respect to our distributions and which therefore may be more advantageous for the general partner to own in lieu of the right to receive incentive distribution payments based on target distribution levels that are less certain to be achieved in the then current business environment. As a result, a reset election may cause our common unitholders to experience dilution in the amount of cash distributions that they would have otherwise received had we not issued common units to our general partner in connection with resetting the target distribution levels related to our general partner’s incentive distribution rights. Please read “Provisions of Our Partnership Agreement Relating to Cash Distributions — General Partner’s Right to Reset Incentive Distribution Levels.”</p><h4 style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Holders of our common units have limited voting rights and are not entitled to elect our general partner or its directors.</h4><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Unlike the holders of common stock in a corporation, unitholders have only limited voting rights on matters affecting our business and, therefore, limited ability to influence management’s decisions regarding our business. Unitholders will have no right on an annual or ongoing basis to elect our general partner or its board of directors. The board of directors of our general partner will be</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">42</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 2pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="776" height="2" alt="image" src="NYSE_AMID_2012/Image_055.png"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">chosen by High Point Infrastructure Partners. Furthermore, if the unitholders are dissatisfied with the performance of our general partner, they will have little ability to remove our general partner. As a result of these limitations, the price at which the common units will trade could be diminished because of the absence or reduction of a takeover premium in the trading price. Our partnership agreement also contains provisions limiting the ability of unitholders to call meetings or to acquire information about our operations, as well as other provisions limiting the unitholders’ ability to influence the manner or direction of management.</p><h4 style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Even if holders of our common units are dissatisfied, they cannot currently remove our general partner without its consent.</h4><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The unitholders currently are unable to remove our general partner without its consent because our general partner and its affiliates owns sufficient units to be able to prevent its removal. The vote of the holders of at least 66 2/3% of all outstanding limited partner units voting together as a single class is required to remove our general partner. HighPoint Infrastructure Partners own 69% of outstanding limited partner units and AIM Midstream Holdings who owns 5% of our outstanding limited partner units. Also, if our general partner is removed without cause during the subordination period and units held by our general partner and its affiliates are not voted in favor of that removal, all remaining subordinated units will automatically convert into common units and any existing arrearages on our common units will be extinguished. A removal of our general partner under these circumstances would adversely affect our common units by prematurely eliminating their distribution and liquidation preference over our subordinated units, which would otherwise have continued until we had met certain distribution and performance tests. Cause is narrowly defined to mean that a court of competent jurisdiction has entered a final, non-appealable judgment finding our general partner liable for actual fraud or willful or wanton misconduct in its capacity as our general partner. Cause does not include most cases of charges of poor management of the business, so the removal of our general partner because of the unitholder’s dissatisfaction with our general partner’s performance in managing our partnership will most likely result in the termination of the subordination period and conversion of all subordinated units to common units.</p><h4 style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Our partnership agreement restricts the voting rights of unitholders owning 20% or more of our common units.</h4><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Unitholders’ voting rights are further restricted by a provision of our partnership agreement providing that any units held by a person that owns 20% or more of any class of units then outstanding, other than our general partner, its affiliates, their transferees and persons who acquired such units with the prior approval of the board of directors of our general partner, cannot vote on any matter.</p><h4 style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Our general partner interest or the control of our general partner may be transferred to a third party without unitholder consent.</h4><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Our general partner may transfer its general partner interest to a third party in a merger or in a sale of all or substantially all of its assets without the consent of the unitholders. Furthermore, our partnership agreement does not restrict the ability of HighPoint Infrastructure Partners and AIM Midstream Holdings to transfer all or a portion of their ownership interest in our general partner to a third party. The new owner of our general partner would then be in a position to replace the board of directors and officers of our general partner with its own designees and thereby exert significant control over the decisions made by the board of directors and officers.</p><h4 style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">We may issue additional units without your approval, which would dilute your existing ownership interests.</h4><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Our partnership agreement does not limit the number of additional limited partner interests that we may issue at any time without the approval of our unitholders. The issuance by us of additional common units or other equity securities of equal or senior rank will have the following effects:</p></li><li style="padding-left: 37pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">our existing unitholders’ proportionate ownership interest in us will decrease;</p></li><li style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 37pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">the amount of cash available for distribution on each unit may decrease;</p></li><li style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 37pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">because a lower percentage of total outstanding units will be subordinated units, the risk that a shortfall in the payment of the minimum quarterly distribution will be borne by our common unitholders will increase;</p></li><li style="padding-left: 37pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">the ratio of taxable income to distributions may increase;</p></li><li style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 37pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">the relative voting strength of each previously outstanding unit may be diminished; and</p></li><li style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 37pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">the market price of the common units may decline.</p><h4 style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 71%;text-align: justify;">HighPoint Infrastructure Partners and AIM Midstream Holdings may sell units in the public or private markets, and such sales could have an adverse impact on the trading price of the common units.</h4><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">AIM Midstream Holdings currently holds an aggregate of 725,120 common units and HighPoint Infrastructure Partners holds 4,526,066 subordinated units and 5,142,857 preferred units. All of the subordinated units will convert into common units at the end of the subordination period. The preferred units are convertible into common units at the election of High Point Infrastructure partners at any time after January 1, 2014. The sale of these units in the public or private markets could have an adverse impact on the price of the common units or on any trading market that may develop.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">43</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 2pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="764" height="2" alt="image" src="NYSE_AMID_2012/Image_056.png"/></span></p><h4 style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 17pt;text-align: left;">Our general partner has a limited call right that may require you to sell your units at an undesirable time or price.</h4><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">If at any time our general partner and its affiliates own more than 80% of the common units, our general partner will have the right, which it may assign to any of its affiliates or to us, but not the obligation, to acquire all, but not less than all, of the common units held by unaffiliated persons at a price that is not less than their then-current market price, as calculated pursuant to the terms of our partnership agreement. As a result, you may be required to sell your common units at an undesirable time or price and may not receive any return on your investment. You may also incur a tax liability upon a sale of your units. AIM Midstream Holdings owns approximately 16.0% of our outstanding common units. HighPoint Infrastructure Partners owns 4,526,066 subordinated units and 5,142,857 preferred units. At the end of the subordination period, assuming no additional issuances of common units (other than upon the conversion of the subordinated units), HighPoint Infrastructure Partners will own approximately 69% of our outstanding common units assuming our preferred units are converted into common units on a one-for-one basis, AIM Midstream Holdings would own 5% of our outstanding common units.</p><h4 style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Your liability may not be limited if a court finds that unitholder action constitutes control of our business.</h4><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">A general partner of a partnership generally has unlimited liability for the obligations of the partnership, except for those contractual obligations of the partnership that are expressly made without recourse to the general partner. Our partnership is organized under Delaware law, and we conduct business in a number of other states. The limitations on the liability of holders of limited partner interests for the obligations of a limited partnership have not been clearly established in some of the other states in which we do business. You could be liable for any and all of our obligations as if you were a general partner if a court or government agency were to determine that:</p></li><li style="padding-left: 37pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">we were conducting business in a state but had not complied with that particular state’s partnership statute; or</p></li><li style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 37pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">your right to act with other unitholders to remove or replace our general partner, to approve some amendments to our partnership agreement or to take other actions under our partnership agreement constitute “control” of our business.</p></li></ul></ol><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Unitholders may have liability to repay distributions that were wrongfully distributed to them.</h4><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Under certain circumstances, unitholders may have to repay amounts wrongfully returned or distributed to them. Under Section 17-607 of the Delaware Revised Uniform Limited Partnership Act, we may not make a distribution to you if the distribution would cause our liabilities to exceed the fair value of our assets. Delaware law provides that for a period of three years from the date of an impermissible distribution, limited partners who received the distribution and who knew at the time of the distribution that it violated Delaware law will be liable to the limited partnership for the distribution amount. Substituted limited partners are liable both for the obligations of the assignor to make contributions to the partnership that were known to the substituted limited partner at the time it became a limited partner and for those obligations that were unknown if the liabilities could have been determined from the partnership agreement. Neither liabilities to partners on account of their partnership interest nor liabilities that are non-recourse to the partnership are counted for purposes of determining whether a distribution is permitted.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s6" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Tax Risks to Common Unitholders</p><h4 style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 71%;text-align: justify;">Our tax treatment depends on our status as a partnership for federal income tax purposes. If the IRS were to treat us as a corporation for federal income tax purposes, which would subject us to entity-level taxation, then our cash available for distribution to our unitholders would be substantially reduced.</h4><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The anticipated after-tax economic benefit of an investment in the common units depends largely on our being treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes. We have not requested, and do not plan to request, a ruling from the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”), on this or any other tax matter affecting us.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Despite the fact that we are a limited partnership under Delaware law, it is possible in certain circumstances for a partnership such as ours to be treated as a corporation for federal income tax purposes. A change in our business or a change in current law could cause us to be treated as a corporation for federal income tax purposes or otherwise subject us to taxation as an entity.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">If we were treated as a corporation for federal income tax purposes, we would pay federal income tax on our taxable income at the corporate tax rate, which is currently a maximum of 35.0%, and would likely pay state and local income tax at varying rates. Distributions would generally be taxed again as corporate distributions (to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits), and no income, gains, losses, deductions, or credits would flow through to you. Because a tax would be imposed upon us as a corporation, our cash available for distribution to you would be substantially reduced. Therefore, if we were treated as a corporation for federal income tax purposes there would be material reduction in the anticipated cash flow and after-tax return to our unitholders, likely causing a substantial reduction in the value of our common units.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Our partnership agreement provides that, if a law is enacted or existing law is modified or interpreted in a manner that subjects us to taxation as a corporation or otherwise subjects us to entity-level taxation for federal, state or local income tax purposes, the</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">44</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 2pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="764" height="2" alt="image" src="NYSE_AMID_2012/Image_057.png"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">minimum quarterly distribution amount and the target distribution amounts may be adjusted to reflect the impact of that law on us.</p><h4 style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 71%;text-align: justify;">If we were subjected to a material amount of additional entity-level taxation by individual states, it would reduce our cash available for distribution to our unitholders.</h4><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Changes in current state law may subject us to additional entity-level taxation by individual states. Because of widespread state budget deficits and other reasons, several states are evaluating ways to subject partnerships to entity-level taxation through the imposition of state income, franchise and other forms of taxation. Imposition of such a tax on us by Texas, and if applicable by any other state, will reduce the cash available for distribution to you. Our partnership agreement provides that, if a law is enacted or existing law is modified or interpreted in a manner that subjects us to entity-level taxation, the minimum quarterly distribution amount and the target distribution amounts may be adjusted to reflect the impact of that law on us.</p><h4 style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 71%;text-align: justify;">The tax treatment of publicly traded partnerships or an investment in our common units could be subject to potential legislative, judicial or administrative changes and differing interpretations, possibly on a retroactive basis.</h4><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The present federal income tax treatment of publicly traded partnerships, including us, or an investment in our common units may be modified by administrative, legislative or judicial interpretation at any time. Recently, members of the U.S. Congress have considered substantive changes to the existing federal income tax laws that affect certain publicly traded partnerships, which, if enacted, may or may not be applied retroactively. Although we are unable to predict whether any of these changes or any other proposals will ultimately be enacted, any such changes could negatively impact the value of an investment in our common units.</p><h4 style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 71%;text-align: justify;">Our unitholders’ share of our income will be taxable to them for U.S. federal income tax purposes even if they do not receive any cash distributions from us.</h4><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Because a unitholder will be treated as a partner to whom we will allocate taxable income which could be different in amount than the cash we distribute, a unitholder’s allocable share of our taxable income will be taxable to it, which may require the payment of federal income taxes and, in some cases, state and local income taxes on its share of our taxable income even if it receives no cash distributions from us. Our unitholders may not receive cash distributions from us equal to their share of our taxable income or even equal to the actual tax liability resulting from that income.</p><h4 style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 71%;text-align: justify;">If the IRS contests the federal income tax positions we take, the market for our common units may be adversely impacted and the cost of any IRS contest will reduce our cash available for distribution to our unitholders.</h4><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">We have not requested a ruling from the IRS with respect to our treatment as a partnership for federal income tax purposes or any other matter affecting us. The IRS may adopt positions that differ from the conclusions of our counsel expressed in this Annual Report or from the positions we take, and the IRS’s positions may ultimately be sustained. It may be necessary to resort to administrative or court proceedings to sustain some or all of our counsel’s conclusions or the positions we take and such positions may not ultimately be sustained. A court may not agree with some or all of our counsel’s conclusions or the positions we take. Any contest with the IRS, and the outcome of any IRS contest, may have a materially adverse impact on the market for our common units and the price at which they trade. In addition, our costs of any contest with the IRS will be borne indirectly by our unitholders and our general partner because the costs will reduce our cash available for distribution.</p><h4 style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Tax gain or loss on the disposition of our common units could be more or less than expected.</h4><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">If you sell your common units, you will recognize a gain or loss for federal income tax purposes equal to the difference between the amount realized and your tax basis in those common units. Because distributions in excess of your allocable share of our net taxable income decrease your tax basis in your common units, the amount, if any, of such prior excess distributions with respect to the common units you sell will, in effect, become taxable income to you if you sell such common units at a price greater than your tax basis in those common units, even if the price you receive is less than your original cost. Furthermore, a substantial portion of the amount realized on any sale of your common units, whether or not representing gain, may be taxed as ordinary income due to potential recapture items, including depreciation recapture. In addition, because the amount realized includes a unitholder’s share of our nonrecourse liabilities, if you sell your common units, you may incur a tax liability in excess of the amount of cash you receive from the sale. Please read “Material Federal Income Tax Consequences — Disposition of Common Units — Recognition of Gain or Loss” for a further discussion of the foregoing.</p><h4 style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 71%;text-align: justify;">Tax-exempt entities and non-U.S. persons face unique tax issues from owning our common units that may result in adverse tax consequences to them.</h4><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Investment in common units by tax-exempt entities, such as employee benefit plans and individual retirement accounts (known as IRAs), and non-U.S. persons raises issues unique to them. For example, virtually all of our income allocated to organizations that are exempt from federal income tax, including IRAs and other retirement plans, will be unrelated business taxable income</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">45</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="776" height="2" alt="image" src="NYSE_AMID_2012/Image_058.png"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">and will be taxable to them. Distributions to non-U.S. persons will be reduced by withholding taxes at the highest applicable effective tax rate, and non-U.S. persons will be required to file U.S. federal income tax returns and pay tax on their share of our taxable income. If you are a tax- exempt entity or a non-U.S. person, you should consult a tax advisor before investing in our common units.</p><h4 style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 71%;text-align: justify;">We will treat each purchaser of common units as having the same tax benefits without regard to the actual common units purchased. The IRS may challenge this treatment, which could adversely affect the value of the common units.</h4><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Because we cannot match transferors and transferees of common units and because of other reasons, we will adopt depreciation and amortization positions that may not conform to all aspects of existing Treasury Regulations. A successful IRS challenge to those positions could adversely affect the amount of tax benefits available to you. Our counsel is unable to opine as to the validity of such filing positions. It also could affect the timing of these tax benefits or the amount of gain from your sale of common units and could have a negative impact on the value of our common units or result in audit adjustments to your tax returns. Please read “Material Federal Income Tax Consequences — Tax Consequences of Unit Ownership — Section 754 Election” for a further discussion of the effect of the depreciation and amortization positions we have adopted.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 71%;text-align: justify;">W <span class="h4">e prorate our items of income, gain, loss and deduction for U.S. federal income tax purposes between transferors and transferees of our units each month based upon the ownership of our units on the first day of each month, instead of on the basis of the date a particular unit is transferred. The IRS may challenge this treatment, which could change the allocation of items of income, gain, loss and deduction among our unitholders.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">We will prorate our items of income, gain, loss and deduction for U.S. federal income tax purposes between transferors and transferees of our units each month based upon the ownership of our units on the first day of each month, instead of on the basis of the date a particular unit is transferred. The use of this proration method may not be permitted under existing Treasury Regulations. Recently, however, the U.S. Treasury Department issued proposed Treasury Regulations that provide a safe harbor pursuant to which publicly traded partnerships may use a similar monthly simplifying convention to allocate tax items among transferor and transferee unitholders. Nonetheless, the proposed regulations do not specifically authorize the use of the proration method we have adopted. If the IRS were to challenge this method or new Treasury regulations were issued, we may be required to change the allocation of items of income, gain, loss and deduction among our unitholders. Andrews Kurth LLP has not rendered an opinion with respect to whether our monthly convention for allocating taxable income and losses is permitted by existing Treasury Regulations. Please read “Material Federal Income Tax Consequences — Disposition of Common Units — Allocations Between Transferors and Transferees.”</p><h4 style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 71%;text-align: justify;">A unitholder whose common units are loaned to a “short seller” to cover a short sale of common units may be considered as having disposed of those common units. If so, he would no longer be treated for federal income tax purposes as a partner with respect to those common units during the period of the loan and may recognize gain or loss from the disposition.</h4><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Because a unitholder whose common units are loaned to a “short seller” to cover a short sale of common units may be considered as having disposed of the loaned common units, he may no longer be treated for federal income tax purposes as a partner with respect to those common units during the period of the loan to the short seller and the unitholder may recognize gain or loss from such disposition. Moreover, during the period of the loan to the short seller, any of our income, gain, loss or deduction with respect to those common units may not be reportable by the unitholder and any cash distributions received by the unitholder as to those common units could be fully taxable as ordinary income. Our counsel has not rendered an opinion regarding the treatment of a unitholder where common units are loaned to a short seller to cover a short sale of common units; therefore, our unitholders desiring to assure their status as partners and avoid the risk of gain recognition from a loan to a short seller are urged to consult a tax advisor to discuss whether it is advisable to modify any applicable brokerage account agreements to prohibit their brokers from loaning their common units.</p><h4 style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 71%;text-align: justify;">We will adopt certain valuation methodologies and monthly conventions for U.S. federal income tax purposes that may result in a shift of income, gain, loss and deduction between our general partner and our unitholders. The IRS may challenge this treatment, which could adversely affect the value of the common units.</h4><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">When we issue additional units or engage in certain other transactions, we will determine the fair market value of our assets and allocate any unrealized gain or loss attributable to our assets to the capital accounts of our unitholders and our general partner. Our methodology may be viewed as understating the value of our assets. In that case, there may be a shift of income, gain, loss and deduction between certain unitholders and our general partner, which may be unfavorable to such unitholders. Moreover, under our valuation methods, subsequent purchasers of common units may have a greater portion of their Internal Revenue Code Section 743(b) adjustment allocated to our tangible assets and a lesser portion allocated to our intangible assets. The IRS may challenge our valuation methods, or our allocation of the Section 743(b) adjustment attributable to our tangible and intangible assets, and allocations of taxable income, gain, loss and deduction between our general partner and certain of our unitholders.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">46</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="776" height="2" alt="image" src="NYSE_AMID_2012/Image_059.png"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">A successful IRS challenge to these methods or allocations could adversely affect the amount of taxable income or loss being allocated to our unitholders. It also could affect the amount of taxable gain from our unitholders’ sale of common units and could have a negative impact on the value of the common units or result in audit adjustments to our unitholders’ tax returns without the benefit of additional deductions.</p><h4 style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 71%;text-align: justify;">The sale or exchange of 50% or more of our capital and profits interests during any twelve-month period will result in the termination of our partnership for federal income tax purposes.</h4><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">We will be considered to have technically terminated our partnership for federal income tax purposes if there is a sale or exchange of 50% or more of the total interests in our capital and profits within a twelve-month period. For purposes of determining whether the 50% threshold has been met, multiple sales of the same interest will be counted only once. Our technical termination would, among other things, result in the closing of our taxable year for all unitholders, which would result in us filing two tax returns (and our unitholders could receive two Schedules K-1 if relief was not available, as described below) for one fiscal year and could result in a deferral of depreciation deductions allowable in computing our taxable income. In the case of a unitholder reporting on a taxable year other than a fiscal year ending December 31, the closing of our taxable year may also result in more than twelve months of our taxable income or loss being includable in his taxable income for the year of termination. Our termination currently would not affect our classification as a partnership for federal income tax purposes, but instead we would be treated as a new partnership for tax purposes. If treated as a new partnership, we must make new tax elections and could be subject to penalties if we are unable to determine that a termination occurred. The IRS has recently announced a publicly traded partnership technical termination relief program whereby, if a publicly traded partnership that technically terminated requests publicly traded partnership technical termination relief and such relief is granted by the IRS, among other things, the partnership will only have to provide one Schedule K-1 to unitholders for the year notwithstanding two partnership tax years. Please read “Material Federal Income Tax Consequences — Disposition of Common Units — Constructive Termination” for a discussion of the consequences of our termination for federal income tax purposes.</p><h4 style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 71%;text-align: justify;">As a result of investing in our common units, you may become subject to state and local taxes and return filing requirements in jurisdictions where we operate or own or acquire properties.</h4><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">In addition to federal income taxes, our unitholders will likely be subject to other taxes, including state and local taxes, unincorporated business taxes and estate, inheritance or intangible taxes that are imposed by the various jurisdictions in which we conduct business or own property now or in the future, even if they do not live in any of those jurisdictions. Our unitholders will likely be required to file state and local income tax returns and pay state and local income taxes in some or all of these various jurisdictions. Further, our unitholders may be subject to penalties for failure to comply with those requirements. We will initially own property or conduct business in a number of states, most of which currently impose a personal income tax on individuals. Most of these states also impose an income tax on corporations and other entities. As we make acquisitions or expand our business, we may own property or conduct business in additional states that impose a personal income tax. It is your responsibility to file all U.S. federal, state and local tax returns. Our counsel has not rendered an opinion on the state or local tax consequences of an investment in our common units.</p><h4 style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Compliance with and changes in tax laws could adversely affect our performance.</h4><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">We are subject to extensive tax laws and regulations, including federal, state and foreign income taxes and transactional taxes such as excise, sales/use, payroll, franchise and ad valorem taxes. New tax laws and regulations  and changes  in existing tax laws  and regulations are continuously being enacted that could result in increased tax expenditures in the future. Many of these tax liabilities are subject to audits by the respective taxing authority. These audits may result in additional taxes as well as interest and penalties.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s6" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Item 1B.

Generally, our available cash is the sum of our (i) cash on hand at the end of a quarter after the payment of our expenses and the establishment of cash reserves and (ii) cash on hand resulting from working capital borrowings made after the end of the quarter. Because we are not subject to an entity-level federal income tax, we have more cash to distribute to our unitholders than would be the case were we subject to federal income tax.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The following table sets forth the number of common, subordinated common and general partner units at December 31, 2012:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s11" style="padding-bottom: 1pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: right;">December 31,</p><p style="padding-left: 402pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="248" height="1" alt="image" src="NYSE_AMID_2012/Image_062.png"/></span></p><p class="s11" style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-bottom: 1pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: right;">2012 2011</p><p class="s31" style="padding-left: 402pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="117" height="1" alt="image" src="NYSE_AMID_2012/Image_063.png"/></span> <span><img width="124" height="1" alt="image" src="NYSE_AMID_2012/Image_064.png"/></span></p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 2pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: right;">(in thousands)</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="776" height="19" alt="image" src="NYSE_AMID_2012/Image_065.png"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Limited partner common units 4,639 4,561</p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Limited partner subordinated units 4,526 4,526</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="776" height="19" alt="image" src="NYSE_AMID_2012/Image_066.png"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">General partner units 185 185</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Our general partner’s initial 2.0% interest in distributions may be reduced if we issue additional units and our general partner does not contribute a proportionate amount of capital to us to maintain its initial 2.0% general partner interest.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The subordination period generally will end and all of the subordinated units will convert into an equal number of common units if we have earned and paid at least $1.65 on each outstanding common and subordinated unit and the corresponding distribution on our general partner’s 2.0% interest for each of three consecutive, non-overlapping four-quarter periods ending on or after September 30, 2014.

By entering into back-to-back purchases and sales of</span></h4><p style="padding-left: 78pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">natural gas, we are able to lock in a fixed-margin on these transactions. We view the segment gross margin earned under our fixed-margin arrangements to be economically equivalent to the fee earned in our fee-based arrangements.</p></li><li style="padding-left: 79pt;text-indent: -36pt;text-align: justify;"><h4 style="display: inline;">Percent-of-Proceeds Arrangements (“POP”). <span class="p">Under these arrangements, we generally gather raw natural gas from producers at the wellhead or other supply points, transport it through our gathering system, process it and sell the residue natural gas and NGLs at market prices.

However, we also have contracts under which we retain a percentage of the resulting NGLs and do not retain a percentage of residue natural gas, such as for our interest in the Burns Point Plant. Our POP arrangements also often contain a fee-based component.</p></li><li style="padding-left: 79pt;text-indent: -36pt;text-align: justify;"><h4 style="display: inline;">Interest in the Burns Point Plant. <span class="p">We account for our interest in the Burns Point Plant using the proportionate consolidation method.

However, a sustained decline in commodity prices could result in a decline in volumes and, thus, a decrease in our fee-based and fixed-margin gross margin. These arrangements provide stable cash flows, but minimal, if any, upside in higher commodity price environments. Under our typical POP arrangement, our gross margin is directly impacted by the commodity prices we realize on our share of natural gas and NGLs received as compensation for processing raw natural gas. However, our POP arrangements also often contain a fee-based component, which helps to mitigate the degree of commodity-price volatility we could experience under these arrangements. We further seek to mitigate our exposure to commodity price risk through our hedging program.

justify;">How We Evaluate Our Operations</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Our management uses a variety of financial and operational metrics to analyze our performance. We view these metrics as important factors in evaluating our profitability and review these measurements on at least a monthly basis for consistency and trend analysis. These metrics include throughput volumes, gross margin and direct operating expenses on a segment basis, and adjusted EBITDA and distributable cash flow on a company-wide basis.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Throughput Volumes</h4><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">In our Gathering and Processing segment, we must continually obtain new supplies of natural gas to maintain or increase throughput volumes on our systems. Our ability to maintain or increase existing volumes of natural gas and obtain new supplies is impacted by (i) the level of work- overs or recompletions of existing connected wells and successful drilling activity in areas currently dedicated to or near our gathering systems,</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">(ii) our ability to compete for volumes from successful new wells in the areas in which we operate, (iii) our ability to obtain natural gas that has been released from other commitments and (iv) the volume of natural gas that we purchase from connected systems. We actively monitor producer activity in the areas served by our gathering and processing systems to pursue new supply opportunities.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">In our Transmission segment, the majority of our segment gross margin is generated by firm capacity reservation fees, as opposed to the actual throughput volumes, on our interstate and intrastate pipelines. Substantially all Transmission segment gross margin is generated under contracts with shippers, including producers, industrial companies, LDCs and marketers, for firm and interruptible natural gas transportation on our pipelines. We routinely monitor natural gas market activities in the areas served by our transmission systems to pursue new shipper opportunities.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Gross Margin and Segment Gross Margin</h4><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Gross margin and segment gross margin are metrics that we use to evaluate our performance. We define segment gross margin in our Gathering and Processing segment as revenue generated from gathering and processing operations less the cost of natural gas, NGLs and condensate purchased. Revenue includes revenue generated from fixed fees associated with the gathering and treating of natural gas and from the sale of natural gas, NGLs and condensate resulting from gathering and processing activities under fixed-margin and percent-of-proceeds arrangements. The cost of natural gas, NGLs and condensate includes volumes of natural</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">55</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="776" height="2" alt="image" src="NYSE_AMID_2012/Image_103.png"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">gas, NGLs and condensate remitted back to producers pursuant to percent-of-proceeds arrangements and the cost of natural gas purchased for our own account, including pursuant to fixed-margin arrangements.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">We define segment gross margin in our Transmission segment as revenue generated from firm and interruptible transportation agreements and fixed-margin arrangements, plus other related fees, less the cost of natural gas purchased in connection with fixed-margin arrangements. Substantially all of our gross margin in this segment is fee-based or fixed-margin, with little to no direct commodity price risk.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Effective January 1, 2011, we changed our gross margin and segment gross margin measure to exclude unrealized mark-to-market adjustments related to our commodity derivatives. For the year ended December 31, 2011, $0.5 million of unrealized losses was excluded from gross margin and the Gathering and Processing segment gross margin.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Effective April 1, 2011, we changed our gross margin and segment gross margin measure to exclude realized gains and losses associated with the early termination of commodity derivative contracts. For the year ended December 31, 2011, $3.0 million in such realized losses was excluded from gross margin and the Gathering and Processing segment gross margin.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Effective October 1, 2012, we changed our segment gross margin measure to exclude construction, operating and maintenance agreement (“COMA”) income. For the year ended December 31, 2012, $0.7 million and $2.7 million in COMA income was excluded from our Gathering and Processing segment gross margin and our Transmission segment gross margin, respectively.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Direct Operating Expenses</h4><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Our management seeks to maximize the profitability of our operations in part by minimizing direct operating expenses without sacrificing safety or the environment. Direct labor costs, insurance costs, ad valorem and property taxes, repair and non-capitalized maintenance costs, integrity management costs, utilities, lost and unaccounted for gas and contract services comprise the most significant portion of our operating expenses. These expenses are relatively stable and largely independent of throughput volumes through our systems, but may fluctuate depending on the activities performed during a specific period.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Adjusted EBITDA</h4><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Adjusted EBITDA is a measure used by our management and by external users of our financial statements such as investors, commercial banks, research analysts and others, to assess:</p><ul id="l27"><li style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 25pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;"><p style="display: inline;">the financial performance of our assets without regard to financing methods, capital structure or historical cost basis;</p></li><li style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 25pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">the ability of our assets to generate cash sufficient to support our indebtedness and make cash distributions to our unit holders and general partner;</p></li><li style="padding-left: 25pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">our operating performance and return on capital as compared to those of other companies in the midstream energy sector, without regard to financing or capital structure; and</p></li><li style="padding-left: 25pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;"><p style="display: inline;">the attractiveness of capital projects and acquisitions and the overall rates of return on alternative investment opportunities.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">We define adjusted EBITDA as net income, plus interest expense, income tax expense, depreciation expense, certain non-cash charges such as non-cash equity compensation, unrealized losses on commodity derivative contracts and selected charges that are unusual or non-recurring, less interest income, income tax benefit, unrealized gains on commodity derivative contracts, amortization of commodity put purchase costs, and selected gains that are unusual or non-recurring. The GAAP measure most directly comparable to adjusted EBITDA is net income.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">We changed our calculation of adjusted EBITDA for 2011 to include the straight-line amortization of commodity put premiums over the life of the associated commodity put contracts. This  is necessary as all unrealized commodity gains and losses, by definition, are excluded in calculating adjusted EBITDA and such premium costs would only be included in the calculation of adjusted EBITDA at the expiration of the put contract. We believe this treatment better reflects the allocation of commodity put premium costs over the benefit period of the commodity put contract. Commodity put premium amortization included in the calculation of adjusted EBITDA was $0.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2011. Further we made a change to the calculation to exclude COMA income from adjusted EBITDA. COMA income excluded from adjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2011 was $0.9 million.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Distributable Cash Flow</h4><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Distributable cash flow is a significant performance metric used by us and by external users of our financial statements, such as investors, commercial banks and research analysts, to compare basic cash flows generated by us to the cash distributions we expect to pay our unitholders. Using this metric, management and external users of our financial statements can quickly compute the coverage ratio of estimated cash flows to planned cash distributions. Distributable cash flow is also an important financial measure for our unitholders since it serves as an indicator of our success in providing a cash return on investment. Specifically, this financial</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">56</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 2pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="764" height="2" alt="image" src="NYSE_AMID_2012/Image_104.png"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">measure indicates to investors whether or not we are generating cash flow at a level that can sustain or support an increase in our quarterly distribution rates. Distributable cash flow is also a quantitative standard used throughout the investment community with respect to publicly- traded partnerships and limited liability companies because the value of a unit of such an entity is generally determined by the unit’s yield (which in turn is based on the amount of cash distributions the entity pays to a unitholder). Distributable cash flow will not reflect changes in working capital balances.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">We define distributable cash flow as adjusted EBITDA plus interest income, less cash paid for interest expense, normalized integrity management costs and normalized maintenance capital expenditures. The GAAP measure most directly comparable to distributable cash flow is net cash flows from operating activities.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Note About Non-GAAP Financial Measures</h4><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Gross margin, adjusted EBITDA and distributable cash flows are all non-GAAP financial measures. Each has important limitations as an analytical tool because it excludes some, but not all, items that affect the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. Management compensates for the limitations of these non-GAAP measures as analytical tools by reviewing the comparable GAAP measures, understanding the differences between the measures and incorporating these data points into management’s decision-making process.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">You should not consider any of gross margin, adjusted EBITDA or distributable cash flow in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Because gross margin, adjusted EBITDA and distributable cash flow may be defined differently by other companies in our industry, our definitions of these non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies, thereby diminishing their utility.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">For a

Our expectations are based on assumptions made by us and information currently available to us. To the extent our underlying assumptions about, or interpretations of, available information prove to be incorrect, our actual results may vary materially from our expected results.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Outlook</h4><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Prior to 2012, the United States and other industrialized countries experienced a significant economic downturn that led to a decline in worldwide energy demand. North American oil and natural gas supply was increasing as a result of the rise in domestic unconventional production. The combination of lower energy demand due to the economic downturn and higher North American oil and natural gas supply resulted in significant declines in oil, NGL and natural gas prices. While oil and NGL prices began to increase steadily during 2011, natural gas prices remained depressed and volatile throughout 2012 due to a continued increase in natural gas supply despite weaker offsetting demand growth. The outlook for a worldwide economic recovery in 2013 remains uncertain, and the timing of a recovery in worldwide demand for energy is difficult to predict. As a result, we expect natural gas prices to remain relatively low in the near term.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Notwithstanding the ongoing volatility in commodity prices, there has been a recent resurgence in the level of acquisition and divestiture activity in the midstream energy industry and we expect that trend to continue. In particular, we believe that opportunities to acquire midstream energy assets from third parties that fulfill our strategic objectives will continue to arise in the foreseeable future.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Supply and Demand Outlook for Natural Gas and Oil</h4><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Natural gas and oil continue to be critical components of energy consumption in the United States. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, or EIA, annual consumption of natural gas in the U.S. was approximately 25.4 trillion cubic feet, or Tcf, in 2012, compared to approximately 24.4 Tcf in 2011, representing an increase of approximately 4.1%. Domestic production of natural gas grew from approximately</p><ol id="l29"><ol id="l30"><li style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><p style="display: inline;">Tcf in 2011 to approximately 25.3 Tcf in 2012, or an 5.4% increase. The industrial and electricity generation sectors currently account for the largest usage of natural gas in the United States, representing approximately 63.9% of the total natural gas consumed in the United States during 2012. In particular, based on a report by the EIA, industrial natural gas demand is expected to grow from 6.1 Tcf in 2009 to 8.2 Tcf in 2020 as a result of an expected recovery in industrial production. According to the EIA, domestic crude oil production was approximately 6.4 million barrels per day, or MMBbl/d, in 2012, compared to approximately 5.7 MMBbl/d in 2011, representing an increase of approximately 12.3%. Domestic crude oil production is expected to continue to increase over time primarily due to improvements in technology that have enabled U.S. onshore producers to economically extract sources of supply, such as secondary and tertiary oil reserves and unconventional oil reserves, that were previously unavailable or uneconomic. We believe that current oil and natural gas prices and the existing demand for oil and natural gas will continue to result in ongoing oil and natural gas-related drilling in the United States as producers seek to increase their production levels. In particular, we believe that drilling activity targeting oil with associated natural gas, such as on our Bazor Ridge and Chatom systems, will remain active. We also believe that the current relatively low natural gas price environment will encourage the development of net industrial facilities that consume natural gas, which will benefit our transmission systems that are strategically located next to inland waterways, such as our AlaTenn and Midla complexes. Although we anticipate continued exploration and production activity in the areas in which we operate, fluctuations in energy prices can affect natural gas production levels over time as well as the timing and level of investment activity by third parties in the exploration for and development of new oil and natural gas reserves. We have no control over the level of oil and natural gas exploration and development activity in the areas of our operations.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Impact of Interest Rates</h4><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The credit markets recently have experienced near-record lows in interest rates. As the overall economy strengthens, it is likely that monetary policy will tighten, resulting in higher interest rates to counter possible inflation. If this occurs, interest rates on floating rate credit facilities and future offerings in the debt capital markets could be higher than current levels, causing our</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">59</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="776" height="2" alt="image" src="NYSE_AMID_2012/Image_114.png"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">financing costs to increase accordingly. As with other yield-oriented securities, our unit price will be impacted by the level of our cash distributions and implied distribution yield. The distribution yield is often used by investors to compare and rank related yield-oriented securities for investment decision-making purposes. Therefore, changes in interest rates, either positive or negative, may affect the yield requirements of investors who invest in our common units, and a rising interest rate environment could have an adverse impact on our unit price and our ability to issue additional equity to make acquisitions, reduce debt or for other purposes.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Credit markets continue to experience near-record lows, which we believe will continue through 2013; however, if monetary policy begins to tighten, our interest rates on floating rate debt facilities and future offerings in the debt capital markets could be higher. An increase in financing costs may affect yield requirements of investors who invest in our common units.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Our expectations are based on assumptions made by us and information currently available to us. To the extent our underlying assumptions about, or interpretations of, available information prove to be incorrect, our actual results may vary materially from our expected results.</p><h4 style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Other Matters</h4><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">We believe the diversity of our assets and our hedged commodity position to protect against downside commodity risk are key elements to long- term growth and sustainable distributable cash flow.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">We continue to actively manage our capital maintenance and capital program. On August 13, 2012, we announced a growth project and expect to construct a midstream system to gather, treat, compress and process natural gas from wells targeting multiple liquids-rich producing formations, including the Eaglebine Formation. The anticipated midstream system would include gathering and processing capacity to support customers&#39; production as well as other third-party development in the area.

As a result of these transactions, which were also consummated on April 15, 2013, High Point acquired both control of our general partner and a majority of our outstanding limited partnership interests. Please read &quot;— ArcLight Transactions.&quot; Contemporaneously with the consummation of these transactions, we also entered into a Fourth Amendment to our credit agreement that, among other things, provides for the waiver of recent covenant breaches relating to consolidated total leverage ratio, modifies the covenant relating to total leverage ratio through the quarter ended December 31, 2014 and reduces the quarterly cash distribution that would otherwise be payable in respect of our subordinated units or Series A Preferred Units for the first, second, third and fourth quarters of 2013.

Of the $15.0 million cash consideration paid by High Point, approximately $2.5 million was used to pay certain transaction expenses of High Point, and the remaining approximately $12.5 million was used to repay borrowings outstanding under the Partnership&#39;s June 2012 amended credit facility in connection with the Fourth Amendment.

Commencing with the Coupon Conversion Quarter, the Series A Preferred Units will receive the Series A Quarterly Distributions in an amount equal to the greater of (a) the amount of aggregate distributions that would be payable had such Series A Preferred Units converted into Common Units and (b) a fixed rate of 0.023571428 multiplied by the conversion price, which will initially be $17.50 per Series A Preferred Unit (subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments) (the “Conversion Price”), paid in arrears within 45 days after the end of each quarter and prior to distributions with respect to the Common Units and Subordinated units. If we elect to reduce distributions on the Series A Preferred Units in order to satisfy our obligation under the Fourth Amendment to reduce distributions on either our subordinated units or Series A Preferred Units in respect of each of the quarters ending June 30, September 30 and December 31, 2013, no part of any such reduction will accrue or accumulate or bear interest.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The record date for the determination of holders entitled to receive Series A Quarterly Distributions will be the same as the record date for determination of Common Unit holders entitled to receive quarterly distributions.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">If we fail to pay in full any Series A Quarterly Distribution, the amount of such unpaid distribution will accrue, accumulate and bear interest at a rate of 6.0% per annum from the first day of the quarter immediately following the quarter for which such distribution is due until paid in full.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The Series A Preferred Units have voting rights that are identical to the voting rights of the Common Units and will vote with the Common Units as a single class, with each Series A Preferred Unit entitled to one vote for each Common Unit into which such Series A Preferred Unit is convertible.

We distributed $16.1 million to our unitholders or $1.73 per unit. For the year ended December 31, 2012 , gross margin increased to $ 50.6 million or 10.2% compared to the same period in 2011. The increase in gross margin was largely a result of the acquisitions of a 50% undivided, non-operating, interest in the Burns Point Plant effective November 1, 2011 and of a 87.4% undivided interest in the Chatom system, effective July 1, 2012 which contributed incremental gross margin of $3.7 million and $5.8 million, respectively. This positive performance was tempered, in part, by the impact of production shut-ins due to Hurricane Isaac, an extended turnaround at our Bazor Ridge system, and reduced gathering and processing volumes associated with one of our offshore pipeline systems which in turn negatively impacted our financial performance in the third and fourth quarters of 2012.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The following table and discussion presents certain of our historical consolidated financial data for the periods indicated.

We are required to comply with certain financial covenants and ratios. Our ability to comply with these restrictions and covenants in the future is uncertain and will be affected by the levels of cash flow from our operations and events or circumstances beyond our control, including events and circumstances that may stem from the condition of financial markets and commodity price levels. Our failure to comply with any of the covenants under our June 2012 amended credit facility could result in a default, which could cause all of our existing indebtedness to become immediately due and payable. We were unable to maintain compliance with consolidated total leverage ratio required by our June 2012 amended credit agreement as it existed prior to the Fourth Amendment during the quarters ended December 31, 2012 and March 31, 2013. On April 15, 2013, we entered into a Fourth Amendment to our June 2012 amended credit agreement that, among other things, modified the maximum permitted consolidated total leverage ratio. The maximum consolidated total leverage ratio permitted by the Fourth Amendment varies by quarter, initially permitting a ratio of 5.90 to 1.00 for the quarter ending June 30, 2013 and then gradually lowering to 4.50 to 1.00 commencing with the quarter ending March 31, 2015.

Our working capital requirements are primarily driven by changes in accounts receivable and accounts payable. These changes are impacted by changes in the prices of commodities that we buy and sell. In general, our working capital requirements increase in periods of rising commodity prices and decrease in periods of declining commodity prices. However, our working capital needs do not necessarily change at the same rate as commodity prices because both accounts receivable and accounts payable are impacted by the same commodity prices. In addition, the timing of payments received from our customers or paid to our suppliers can also cause fluctuations in working capital because we settle with most of our larger suppliers and customers on a monthly basis and often near the end of the month. We expect that our future working capital requirements will be impacted by these same factors. Our working capital deficit was $3.6 million at December 31, 2012.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><table style="border-collapse:collapse;margin-left:7pt" cellspacing="0"><tr style="height:69pt"><td style="width:331pt"><p class="s34" style="text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: left;">Cash Flows</p><p class="s15" style="padding-top: 2pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The following table reflects cash flows for the applicable periods:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s12" style="padding-left: 1pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">(in thousands)</p></td><td style="width:84pt;border-bottom-style:solid;border-bottom-width:1pt"><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p></td><td style="width:82pt;border-bottom-style:solid;border-bottom-width:1pt"><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s21" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 18pt;padding-right: 4pt;text-indent: -10pt;text-align: left;">For the Year Ended December 31,</p></td><td style="width:85pt;border-bottom-style:solid;border-bottom-width:1pt"><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p></td></tr><tr style="height:14pt"><td style="width:331pt"><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p></td><td style="width:84pt;border-top-style:solid;border-top-width:1pt;border-bottom-style:solid;border-bottom-width:1pt"><p class="s21" style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 15pt;padding-right: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">2012</p></td><td style="width:82pt;border-top-style:solid;border-top-width:1pt;border-bottom-style:solid;border-bottom-width:1pt"><p class="s21" style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 32pt;padding-right: 31pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">2011</p></td><td style="width:85pt;border-top-style:solid;border-top-width:1pt;border-bottom-style:solid;border-bottom-width:1pt"><p class="s21" style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 35pt;padding-right: 31pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">2010</p></td></tr><tr style="height:14pt"><td style="width:331pt" bgcolor="#CCEEFF"><p class="s15" style="padding-left: 1pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Net cash provided by (used in):</p></td><td style="width:84pt;border-top-style:solid;border-top-width:1pt" bgcolor="#CCEEFF"><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p></td><td style="width:82pt;border-top-style:solid;border-top-width:1pt" bgcolor="#CCEEFF"><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p></td><td style="width:85pt;border-top-style:solid;border-top-width:1pt" bgcolor="#CCEEFF"><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p></td></tr><tr style="height:14pt"><td style="width:331pt"><p class="s15" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Operating activities</p></td><td style="width:84pt"><p class="s15" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 1pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">$ 18,348</p></td><td style="width:82pt"><p class="s15" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 4pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">$ 10,432</p></td><td style="width:85pt"><p class="s15" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-right: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: right;">$ 13,791</p></td></tr><tr style="height:14pt"><td style="width:331pt" bgcolor="#CCEEFF"><p class="s15" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Investing activities</p></td><td style="width:84pt" bgcolor="#CCEEFF"><p class="s15" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-right: 4pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: right;">(62,427)</p></td><td style="width:82pt" bgcolor="#CCEEFF"><p class="s15" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-right: 4pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: right;">(41,744)</p></td><td style="width:85pt" bgcolor="#CCEEFF"><p class="s15" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-right: 2pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: right;">(10,268)</p></td></tr><tr style="height:13pt"><td style="width:331pt"><p class="s15" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">Financing activities</p></td><td style="width:84pt"><p class="s15" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-right: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: right;">43,784</p></td><td style="width:82pt"><p class="s15" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-right: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: right;">32,120</p></td><td style="width:85pt"><p class="s15" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-right: 2pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: right;">(4,609)</p></td></tr></table><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 17pt;text-align: justify;">Year Ended December 31, 2012 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2011</h4><h4 style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Operating Activities <span class="p">.

We categorize our capital expenditures as either:</p><ul id="l41"><li style="padding-left: 37pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;"><p style="display: inline;">maintenance capital expenditures, which are cash expenditures (including expenditures for the addition or improvement to, or the replacement of, our capital assets or for the acquisition of existing, or the construction or development of new, capital assets) made to maintain our long-term operating income or operating capacity; or</p></li><li style="padding-left: 37pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;"><p style="display: inline;">expansion capital expenditures, which are cash expenditures incurred for acquisitions or capital improvements that we expect will increase our operating income or operating capacity over the long term.</p></li></ul></li></ol><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Historically, our maintenance capital expenditures have not included all capital expenditures required to maintain volumes on our systems. It is customary in the regions in which we operate for producers to bear the cost of well connections, but we cannot be assured that this will be the case in the future. For the year ended December 31, 2012 capital expenditures totaled $11.7 million including expansion capital expenditures of</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">$4.4 million, maintenance capital expenditures of $6.5 million and reimbursable project expenditures (capital expenditures for which we expect to be reimbursed for all or part of the expenditures by a third party) of $0.8 million. Although we classified our capital expenditures as expansion and maintenance, we believe those classifications approximate, but do not necessarily correspond to, the definitions of estimated maintenance capital expenditures and expansion capital expenditures under our partnership agreement.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">We anticipate that we will continue to make significant expansion capital expenditures in the future. Consequently, our ability to develop and maintain sources of funds to meet our capital requirements is critical to our ability to meet our growth objectives. As a result of the contribution of the High Point assets to the Partnership, the Fourth Amendment, the PIK Distribution on the Series A Preferred Units and the Preferred Unit Distribution Waiver, we expect to generate sufficient cash flow from operations and borrowings under our June 2012 amended credit facility, as needed, to meet our requirements for future expansion capital expenditures for the next twelve months from the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">We depend on our June 2012 amended credit facility for future capital needs and may use it to fund a portion of cash distributions to unitholders, as necessary, depending on the level of our operating cashflow. We are required to comply with certain financial covenants and ratios. Our ability to comply with these restrictions and covenants in the future is uncertain and will be affected by the levels of cash flow from our operations and events or circumstances beyond our control, including events and circumstances that may stem from the condition of financial markets and commodity price levels. Our failure to comply with any of the covenants under our June 2012 amended credit facility could result in a default, which could cause all of our existing indebtedness to become immediately due and payable. We were unable to maintain compliance with consolidated total leverage ratio required by our June 2012 amended credit agreement as it existed prior to the Fourth Amendment during the quarters ended December 31, 2012 and March 31, 2013. On April 15, 2013, we entered into a Fourth Amendment to our June 2012 amended credit agreement that, among other things, modified the maximum permitted consolidated total leverage ratio. The maximum consolidated total leverage ratio</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">72</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="776" height="2" alt="image" src="NYSE_AMID_2012/Image_137.png"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">permitted by the Fourth Amendment varies by quarter, initially permitting a ratio of 5.90 to 1.00 for the quarter ending June 30, 2013 and then gradually lowering to 4.50 to 1.00 commencing with the quarter ending March 31, 2015.

These regulations require transportation pipeline operators to implement continuous integrity management programs over a seven-year cycle. Our current program will be completed in 2012. In connection with the acquisition of our assets from Enbridge we initiated a comprehensive review of the program and concluded that there were sixteen high consequence areas, or HCAs, in addition to those identified by our Predecessor that required further testing pursuant to DOT regulations. We expect to incur $2.0 million in integrity management expenses in 2013 associated with these HCAs to complete the current integrity management program.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Because DOT regulations require integrity management activities for each HCA to be performed within seven years from when they were last performed, we expect

</span>required by our Title V Air Permit, we determined that we underreported to the MDEQ the SO <span class="s27">2 </span>(sulfur dioxide) emissions from the Bazor Ridge plant for 2009 and 2010. In addition, we determined that certain SO <span class="s27">2 </span>emissions during 2009 and 2010 exceeded the reportable quantity threshold <span class="p">under the federal Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act, or EPCRA, requiring notification of various governmental authorities.

A Consent Agreement and Final Order was executed, which included a civil penalty of $23,010 . After discussion with the MDEQ, in February 2012 we submitted an application to amend our Title V Air Permit to </span>account for these SO <span class="s27">2 </span>emissions. The MDEQ is currently processing this permit application. In December 2011, EPA Region IV performed an <span class="p">inspection of the plant, and they followed up with an Information Request in May 2012.

As a result of the contribution of the High Point assets to the Partnership, the Fourth Amendment, the PIK Distribution on the Series A Preferred Units and the Preferred Unit Distribution Waiver, we expect to generate sufficient cash flow from operations and borrowings under our June 2012 amended credit facility, as needed, to:</p></li><li style="padding-left: 25pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">pay the required distribution on the Series A Convertible Preferred Units (a portion of which is payable in Series A PIK Units, less the Preferred Unit Distribution Waiver); and</p></li><li style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">pay at least the minimum quarterly distribution on all outstanding common units, subordinate units and general partner units. in each case, for the next twelve months following the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Our Credit Facility</h4><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Prior to the Fourth Amendment, we had a number of credit facilities. The first was a $100 million revolving credit facility that we entered into in August 2011.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">On June 27, 2012, we amended that August 2011 credit facility to increase the commitments from an aggregate principal amount of $100 million to an aggregate principal amount of $200 million , evidenced by a credit agreement with Bank of America, N.A., as Administrative Agent, Collateral Agent and L/C Issuer; Comerica Bank and Citicorp North America, Inc., as Co-Syndication Agents; BBVA Compass, as Documentation Agent; and the other financial institutions party thereto.</p><p class="s39" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">That June 2012 <span style=" color: #000;">amended credit facility provided for a maximum borrowing equal to the lesser of (i) $200 million or (ii) 4.50 times adjusted consolidated EBITDA. Prior to the Third Amendment described below, we could elect to have loans under the June 2012 amended credit facility bear interest either at a Eurodollar-based rate plus a margin ranging from 2.25% to 3.50% depending on our total leverage ratio then in effect, or a base rate which is a fluctuating rate per annum equal to the highest of (a) the Federal Funds Rate plus 1/2 of 1%, (b) the rate of interest in effect for such day as publicly announced from time to time by Bank of America as its “prime rate”, or (c) the Eurodollar Rate plus 1.00% plus a margin ranging from 1.25% to 2.50% depending on the total leverage ratio then in effect. We also paid a commitment fee of 0.50% per annum on the undrawn portion of the revolving loan.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">For the twelve months ended December 31, 2012 , 2011 and 2010 , the weighted average interest rate on borrowings under our credit facilities was approximately 4.09% , 6.71% , and 7.48% , respectively.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Our obligations under each of our credit facilities, including the current June 2012 amended credit facility, are secured by a first mortgage in favor of the lenders in our real property. Advances made under the June 2012 amended credit facility are guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by our subsidiaries (“Guarantors”). These guarantees are full and unconditional and joint and several among the Guarantors. The terms of the June 2012 amended credit facility include covenants that restrict our ability to make cash distributions and acquisitions in some circumstances. The remaining principal balance of loans and any accrued and unpaid interest will be due and payable in full on the maturity date, August 1, 2016 .</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The June 2012 amended credit facility also contains customary representations and warranties (including those relating to organization and authorization, compliance with laws, absence of defaults, material agreements and litigation) and customary events of default (including those relating to monetary defaults, covenant defaults, cross defaults and bankruptcy events). The primary financial covenants contained in the June 2012 amended credit facility are (i) a total leverage ratio test (which, prior the Fourth Amendment could not exceed 4.50 ) and a minimum interest coverage ratio test (which, prior to the Third Amendment could not less be than 2.50 ).</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">As of December 31, 2012, the total leverage ratio test, one of the primary financial covenants that we were required to maintain under our June 2012 amended credit facility, exceeded the leverage covenant. As a result, on December 26, 2012, the Partnership entered into the Third Amendment and Waiver to Credit Agreement, dated as of December 26, 2012 (the “Third Amendment”). The Third Amendment provided for a waiver of the Partnership&#39;s compliance with the Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio with respect to the quarter ending December 31, 2012 and for one month thereafter. The Third Amendment also required the Partnership to provide certain financial and operating information of the Partnership on a monthly basis for 2013 and for any month after 2013 in which the Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio of the Partnership is in excess of 4.00 to 1.00. The remaining material terms and conditions of the June 2012 amended credit facility, including pricing, maturity and covenants, remained unchanged by the Third Amendment.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">On January 24, 2013, the Partnership entered into the second waiver to the June 2012 amended credit facility that extended the waiver period with respect to the Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio to March 31, 2013 (and subsequently extended to April 16, 2013). Additional covenants during the waiver period included i) total outstanding borrowings under the June 2012 amended credit facility could not exceed $150 million; ii) restrictions on certain acquisitions; iii) an increase to the Eurodollar rate by 0.50%; iv)</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">74</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="776" height="2" alt="image" src="NYSE_AMID_2012/Image_140.png"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">additional fees of 0.125% of the principal amount on each of February 28, 2013 and March 31, 2013; and v) execution of a compliance certificate.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">At December 31, 2012, our total indebtedness was approximately $130.9 million, which caused our total leverage to EBITDA ratio to be approximately 5.7-to-1. Prior to the Fourth Amendment to our June 2012 amended credit agreement, the maximum value permitted under the June 2012 amended credit agreement for that ratio could not exceed 4.5 to 1.0. As of March 31, 2013, outstanding debt under our June 2012 amended credit facility was approximately $139 million, which further exceeded the maximum Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio as of that date and constituted a default under the June 2012 amended credit agreement. Please read “Recent Developments — Fourth Amendment to Credit Agreement” for a description of the Fourth Amendment.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">On April 15, 2013, we repaid approximately $12.5 million in outstanding borrowings under the June 2012 amended credit agreement and entered into the Fourth Amendment to our June 2012 amended credit agreement in connection with the ArcLight Transactions. As a result, we had approximately $130 million of outstanding borrowings as of April 15, 2013 and approximately $45 million of available borrowing capacity as a result of the reduction of our borrowing capacity to a total of $175 million as described below. Until June 30, 2013, we will not be required to meet a Consolidated Leverage Ratio under our June 2012 amended credit facility. We expect that we will have availability under our June 2012 amended credit facility and be able to meet the Fourth Amendment&#39;s Consolidated Leverage Ratio once it is reinstated on June 30, 2013, but  there can be no assurance that  will  be the case or what  that availability might be.

ended December 31, 2012 and March 31, 2013. As of April 15, 2013, we had approximately $130 million of outstanding borrowings and approximately $45 million of available borrowing capacity as a result of the reduction of our borrowing capacity to a total of $175 million as described herein. Until June 30, 2013, we will not be required to meet a Consolidated Leverage Ratio under our June 2012 amended credit facility. We expect that we will have ava ilability under our June 2012 amended credit facility and be able to meet the Fourth Amendment&#39;s Consolidated Leverage Ratio once it is reinstated on June 30, 2013, but there can be no assurance that will be the case or what that availability might be.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">As a result of the contribution of the High Point assets to the Partnership, the Fourth Amendment, the PIK Distribution on the Series A Preferred Units and the Preferred Unit Distribution Waiver, we expect to generate sufficient cash flow from operations and borrowings under our June 2012 amended credit facility, as needed, to :</p></li><li style="padding-left: 25pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">pay the required distribution on the Series A Convertible Preferred Units (a portion of which is payable in Series A PIK Units, less the Preferred Unit Distribution Waiver);</p></li><li style="padding-left: 25pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;"><p style="display: inline;">pay at least the minimum quarterly distribution on all outstanding common units, subordinate units and general partner units; and</p></li><li style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 25pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;"><p style="display: inline;">meet our requirements for working capital and capital expenditures,</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">in each case, for the next twelve months following the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">We depend on our June 2012 amended credit facility for future capital needs and may use it to fund a portion of cash distributions to unitholders, as necessary, depending on the level of our operating cashflow. We are required to comply with certain financial covenants and ratios. Our ability to comply with these restrictions and covenants in the future is uncertain and will be affected by the levels of cash flow from our operations and events or circumstances beyond our control, including events and circumstances that may stem from the condition of financial markets and commodity price levels. Our failure to comply with any of the covenants under our June 2012 amended credit facility could result in a default, which could cause all of our existing indebtedness to become immediately due and payable. We were unable to maintain compliance with consolidated total leverage ratio required by our June 2012 amended credit agreement as it existed prior to the Fourth Amendment during the quarters ended December 31, 2012 and March 31, 2013. On April 15, 2013, we entered into a Fourth Amendment to our June 2012 amended credit agreement that, among other things, modified the maximum permitted consolidated total leverage ratio. The maximum consolidated total leverage ratio permitted by the Fourth Amendment varies by quarter, initially permitting a ratio of 5.90 to 1.00 for the quarter ending June 30, 2013 and then gradually lowering to 4.50 to 1.00 commencing with the quarter ending March 31, 2015. Please read &quot;Management&#39;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Liquidity and Capital Resources — Our Credit Facility&quot; for more information about the Fourth Amendment and our June 2012 amended credit facility.</p><h4 style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Customer Concentration and Credit Risk</h4><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Substantially all of the natural gas produced on our Lafitte system is sold to ConocoPhillips for use at its Alliance Refinery in Plaquemines Parish, Louisiana under a contract that expires in 2023.

The weighted-average remaining life on our POP contracts in this segment is approximately four years.

ExxonMobil, Enbridge Marketing (US) L.P., and Calpine Corporation are the three largest purchasers of natural gas and transmission capacity, respectively, in our Transmission segment and accounted for approximately 50% , 22% and 10% , respectively, of our segment revenue for the year ended December 31, 2012 .</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">We examine the creditworthiness of third-party customers to whom we extend credit and manage our exposure to credit risk through credit analysis, credit approval, credit limits and monitoring procedures, and for certain transactions, we may request letters of credit, prepayments or guarantees.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Although we have gathering, processing or transmission contracts with each of these customers of varying duration, if one or more of these customers were to default on their contract or if we were unable to renew our contract with one or more of these customers on favorable terms, we may not be able to replace any of these customers in a timely fashion, on favorable terms or at all.

style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Results of operations in our Transmission segment are directly affected by seasonality due to higher demand for natural gas during the winter months, primarily driven by our LDC customers. On our AlaTenn system, we offer some customers seasonally-adjusted firm transportation rates that require customers to reserve capacity at rates that are higher in the period from October to March compared to other times of the year. On our Midla system, we offer customers seasonally-adjusted firm transportation reservation volumes that allow customers to reserve more capacity during the period from October to March compared to other times of the year. The combination of seasonally-adjusted rates and reservation volumes, as well as higher volumes overall, result in higher revenue and segment gross margin in our Transmission segment during the period from October to March compared to other times of the year. We generally do not experience seasonality in our Gathering and Processing segment.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s6" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires our and our Predecessor’s management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the period. Actual results could differ from these estimates. The policies and estimates discussed below are considered by our and Predecessor’s management to be critical to an understanding of the financial statements because their application requires the most significant judgments from management in estimating matters for financial reporting that are inherently uncertain. See the description of our accounting policies in the notes to the financial statements for additional information about our critical accounting policies and estimates.</p><p class="s25" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Use of Estimates. <span class="p">The preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect our reported financial positions and results of operations. We review significant estimates and judgments affecting our consolidated financial statements on a recurring basis and record the effect of any necessary adjustments prior to their publication. Estimates and judgments are based on information available at the time such estimates and judgments are made. Adjustments made with respect to the use of these estimates and judgments often relate to information not previously available. Uncertainties with respect to such estimates and judgments are inherent in the preparation of financial statements. Estimates and judgments are used in, among other things, (1) estimating unbilled revenue and operating and general and administrative costs, (2) developing fair value assumptions, including estimates of future cash flows and discount rates, (3) analyzing tangible and intangible assets for possible impairment,</span></p><ol id="l43"><li style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><p style="display: inline;">estimating the useful lives of our assets and (5) determining amounts to accrue for contingencies, guarantees and indemnifications. Actual results could differ materially from our estimates.</p><p class="s25" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Property, Plant and Equipment. <span class="p">In general, depreciation is the systematic and rational allocation of an asset’s cost, less its residual value (if any), to the period it benefits. Our property, plant and equipment is depreciated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. The costs of renewals and betterments which extend the useful life of property, plant and equipment are also capitalized. The costs of repairs, replacements and maintenance projects are expensed as incurred.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Our estimate of depreciation incorporates assumptions regarding the useful economic lives and residual values of our assets. As circumstances warrant, depreciation estimates are reviewed to determine if any changes are needed. Such changes could involve an increase or decrease in estimated useful lives or salvage values which would impact future depreciation expense.</p><p class="s25" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Impairment of Long-Lived Assets. <span class="p">We assess our long-lived assets for impairment on authoritative guidance. A long-lived asset is tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate its carrying amount may exceed its fair value. Fair</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">77</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 2pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="776" height="2" alt="image" src="NYSE_AMID_2012/Image_143.png"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 208%;text-align: left;">values are based on the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the assets. We incurred no impairment charges during the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011.</p><p class="s25" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Environmental Remediation. <span class="p">Current accounting guidelines require us to recognize a liability and expense associated with environmental remediation if (i) government agencies mandate such activities, (ii) the existence of a liability is probable and (iii) the amount can be reasonably estimated. As of December 31, 2012 we have recorded no liability for remediation expenditures. If governmental regulations change, we could be required to incur remediation costs which may have a material impact on our profitability.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s25" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Asset Retirement Obligations. <span class="p">As of December 31, 2012, we have recorded liabilities of $8.3 million for future asset retirement obligations associated with our pipeline assets. Related accretion expense has been recorded in interest expense as discussed in Note 1 in our consolidated financial statements. The recognition of an asset retirement obligation requires that management make numerous estimates, assumptions and judgments regarding such factors as costs of remediation, timing of settlement to changes in the estimate of the costs of remediation. Any such changes that result in upward or downward revisions in the estimated obligation will result in an adjustment to the related capitalized asset or corresponding liability on a prospective basis and an adjustment in our depreciation expense in future periods.</span></p><p class="s25" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Equity-Based Awards. <span class="p">We account for equity-based awards in accordance with applicable guidance, which establishes standards of accounting for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services. Equity-based compensation expense is recorded based upon the fair value of the award at grant date. Such costs are recognized as expense on a straight-line basis over the corresponding vesting period.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">During 2010, the fair values of the phantom-unit grants that we made were calculated based on several valuation models, including a discounted cash flow, or DCF, model, a comparable company multiple analysis and a comparable transaction multiple analysis. The DCF model included certain market assumptions related to future throughput volumes, projected fees and/or prices, expected costs of sales and direct operating costs and risk adjusted discount rates. Both the comparable company analysis and comparable transaction analysis contain significant assumptions consistent with the DCF model, in addition to assumptions related to comparability, appropriateness of multiples (primarily based on EBITDA and distributable cash flow) and certain assumptions in the calculation of enterprise value. The initial valuation of $10.00 per common unit was prepared in August 2009 in connection with our formation in anticipation of the acquisition of our assets from a subsidiary of Enbridge Energy Partners, L.P. In November 2009, we received indirect third-party investments at that same valuation in connection with the acquisition of our assets from Enbridge. We assessed the adequacy of that valuation on each grant date subsequent to the initial fair value calculation to determine if events or circumstances had occurred that would cause that valuation to become less relevant, noting none. Moreover, we received additional indirect third-party investments at $10.00 per common unit in each of September and November 2010. As a result, we maintained that $10.00 valuation for phantom-unit grants made in November 2009, March 2010 and October 2010.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">For the phantom-unit grants made during March 2011, the fair values of the grants were calculated by affiliates of our general partner as $13.67 per common unit based on several valuation models as of December 31, 2010, including a DCF model, a comparable company multiple analysis and a comparable transaction multiple analysis. The DCF model includes certain market assumptions related to future throughput volumes, projected fees and/or prices, expected costs of sales and direct operating costs and risk adjusted discount rates. Both the comparable company analysis and comparable transaction analysis contain significant assumptions consistent with the DCF model, in addition to assumptions related to comparability, appropriateness of multiples (primarily based on EBITDA and distributable cash flow) and certain assumptions in the calculation of enterprise value. The year-end 2010 valuation was completed in January 2011. We assessed the adequacy of that valuation in connection with the March 2011 grant date to determine if events or circumstances had occurred since December 31, 2010 that would cause that valuation to become less relevant, noting none.</p><p class="s25" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Revenue Recognition. <span class="p">We recognize revenue when all of the following criteria are met: (1) persuasive evidence of an exchange arrangement exists, (2) delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, (3) the price is fixed or determinable and (4) collectability is reasonably assured. We record revenue and cost of product sold on the gross basis for those transactions where we act as the principal and take title to natural gas, NGLs or condensates that is purchased for resale. When our customers pay us a fee for providing a service such as gathering, treating or transportation we record those fees separately in revenue. Under keep-whole contracts, we keep the NGLs extracted and return the processed natural gas or value of the natural gas to the producer.</span></p><p class="s25" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Interest in the Burns Point Plant. <span class="p">We account for our interest in the Burns Point Plant using the proportionate consolidation method. Under this method, we include in our consolidated statement of operations, our value of plant revenues taken in-kind and plant expenses reimbursed to the operator.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">78</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="776" height="2" alt="image" src="NYSE_AMID_2012/Image_144.png"/></span></p><p class="s25" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Natural Gas Imbalance Accounting. <span class="p">Quantities of natural gas over-delivered or under-delivered related to operational balancing agreements are recorded monthly as inventory or as a payable using weighted average prices at the time the imbalance was created. Monthly, gas imbalances over-delivered are valued at the lower of cost or market; gas imbalances under-delivered are valued at replacement cost. These imbalances are typically settled in the following month with deliveries of natural gas. Under the contracts, imbalance cash-outs are recorded as a sale or purchase of natural gas, as appropriate.</span></p><p class="s25" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Price Risk Management Activities. <span class="p">We have structured our hedging activities in order to minimize our commodity pricing and interest rate risks and to help maintain compliance with certain financial covenants in our June 2012 amended credit facility. These hedging activities rely upon forecasts of our expected operations and financial structure through December 2013. If our operations or financial structure are significantly different from these forecasts, we could be subject to adverse financial results as a result of these hedging activities. We mitigate this potential exposure by retaining an operational cushion between our forecasted transactions and the level of hedging activity executed.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">From the inception of our hedging program in December 2009, we used mark-to-market accounting for our commodity hedges and interest rate caps. We record monthly realized gains and losses on hedge instruments based upon cash settlements information. The settlement amounts vary due to the volatility in the commodity market prices throughout each month. We also record unrealized gains and losses quarterly based upon the future value on mark-to-market hedges through their expiration dates. The expiration dates vary but are currently no later than December 2013 for our commodity hedges. We monitor and review hedging positions regularly.</p><p class="s6" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Recent Accounting Pronouncements</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">In December 2011, the FASB issued ASU No. 2011-11 <i>Disclosures about Offsetting Assets and Liabilities </i>. The ASU requires additional disclosures about the impact of offsetting, or netting, on a company’s financial position, and is effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2013 and interim periods within those annual periods, and retrospectively for all comparative periods presented. Under US GAAP, derivative assets and liabilities can be offset under certain conditions. The ASU requires disclosures showing both gross information and net information about instruments eligible for offset in the balance sheet. The Partnership adopted the provisions of ASU 2011-11 for the year ended December 31, 2012.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s6" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk</p><h4 style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Commodity Price Risk</h4><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">We are exposed to the impact of market fluctuations in the prices of natural gas, NGLs and condensate in our Gathering and Processing segment. Both our profitability and our cash flow are affected by volatility in the prices of these commodities. Natural gas and NGL prices are impacted by changes in the supply and demand for natural gas and NGLs, as well as market uncertainty. For a discussion of the volatility of natural gas and NGL prices, please read “Risk Factors.” Adverse effects on our cash flow from reductions in natural gas and NGL product prices could adversely affect our ability to make distributions to unitholders. We manage this commodity price exposure through an integrated strategy that includes management of our contract portfolio, optimization of our assets, and the use of derivative contracts. Our overall direct exposure to movements in natural gas prices is minimal as a result of natural hedges inherent in our current contract portfolio. Natural gas prices, however, can also affect our profitability indirectly by influencing the level of drilling activity in our areas of operation. We are a net seller of NGLs, and as such our financial results are exposed to fluctuations in NGLs pricing.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">To minimize the effect of commodity prices and maintain our cash flow and the economics of our development plans, we enter into commodity hedge contracts from time to time. The terms of the contracts depend on various factors, including management’s view of future commodity prices, acquisition economics on purchased assets and future financial commitments. This hedging program is designed to mitigate the effect of commodity price downturns while allowing us to participate in some commodity price upside. Management regularly monitors the commodity markets and financial commitments to determine if, when, and at what level commodity hedging is appropriate in accordance with policies that are established by the board of directors of our general partner. Currently, the commodity derivatives are in the form of swaps, puts and collars. As of December 31, 2012 , the aggregate notional volume of our commodity derivatives was 15.1 million gallons.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">We enter into commodity contracts with multiple counterparties. We may be required to post collateral with our counterparties in connection with our derivative positions. As of December 31, 2012 , we have not posted collateral with our counterparties. The counterparties are not required to post collateral with us in connection with their derivative positions. Netting agreements are in place with our counterparties that permit us to offset our commodity derivative asset and liability positions.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">In June 2011, the Board of Directors of our general partner determined that we would gain operational and strategic flexibility from canceling our then-existing NGL swap contracts and entering into new NGL swap contracts with an existing counterparty that extended through the end of 2012 . During 2012, we entered into additional commodity contracts with existing counterparties</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">79</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 2pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="776" height="2" alt="image" src="NYSE_AMID_2012/Image_145.png"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">to hedge our 2012 and 2013 exposure to commodity prices.

Our interest rate cap contracts that limited our interest rate exposure to 4% expired on December 2, 2011. We currently do not hold nor do we anticipate entering into any interest rate hedging contracts at this time, but changing market conditions may require interest rate hedging contracts to mitigate our exposure to interest rate risk.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The credit markets have recently experienced historical lows in interest rates. As the overall economy strengthens, it is possible that monetary policy will tighten, resulting in higher interest rates. Interest rates on floating rate credit facilities and future debt offerings could be higher than current levels, causing our financing costs to increase accordingly.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A hypothetical increase or decrease in interest rates by 1.0% would have changed our interest expense by $0.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2012.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s6" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Item 8.

An evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) or Rule 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”)) was performed as of December 31, 2012. Management has excluded American Midstream Chatom, LLC from its assessment of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2012 because it was acquired by the Partnership in a purchase business combination during 2012. This evaluation was performed by our management, with the participation of our general partner’s President and Chief Executive Officer and Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.

Directors, Executive Officers and Corporate Governance</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">We are managed by the directors and executive officers of our general partner, American Midstream GP, LLC. Our general partner is not elected by our unitholders and will not be subject to re-election in the future. High Point Infrastructure Partners and AIM Midstream Holdings own all of the membership interests in our general partner. Our general partner has a board of directors, and our unitholders are not entitled to elect the directors or directly or indirectly participate in our management or operations. AIM, Eagle River Ventures, LLC, Stockwell Fund II, L.P. and certain of our executive officers own all of the membership interests in AIM Midstream Holdings. In addition, Messrs. Hellman and Diffendal served on the board of directors of our general partner prior to their resignations on April 15, 2013 in connection with the ArcLight Transactions and are principals of and have ownership interests in AIM. Our general partner owes certain fiduciary duties to our unitholders. Our general partner is liable, as general partner, for all of our debts (to the extent not paid from our assets), except for indebtedness or other obligations that are made specifically nonrecourse to it. Whenever possible, we intend to incur indebtedness that is nonrecourse to our general partner.</p><h4 style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Change of Control of the General Partner and the Partnership</h4><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Through the acquisition of the 90% interest in our general partner, the acquisition of all of our 4,526,066 subordinated units and</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">the issuance of the 5,142,857 Series A Preferred Units, High Point acquired control of our general partner and a majority of our outstanding limited partnership interests. In connection with High Point&#39;s acquisition of control of our general partner, each of Robert B. Hellman, Jr., Edward O. Diffendal and L. Kent Moore resigned from the board. Mr. Hellman also resigned as chairman of the board. These resignations occurred on April 15, 2013. High Point, as the owner of 90% of the limited liability company interests in our general partner, will have the right to fill the board vacancies created by these resignations.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Our partnership agreement provides for the conflicts committee of the board of directors of our general partner, or the Conflicts Committee, as delegated by the board of directors of our general partner as circumstances warrant, to review conflicts of interest between us and our general partner or between us and affiliates of our general partner. If a matter is submitted to the Conflicts Committee, which will consist solely of independent directors, for their review and approval, the Conflicts Committee will determine if the resolution of a conflict of interest that has been presented to it by the board of directors of our general partner is fair and reasonable to us. The members of the Conflicts Committee may not be executive officers or employees of our general partner or directors, executive officers or employees of its affiliates. In addition, the members of the Conflicts Committee must meet the independence and experience standards established by the NYSE and the Exchange Act for service on an audit committee of a board of directors. Any matters approved by the Conflicts Committee will be conclusively deemed to be fair and reasonable to us, approved by all of our partners and not a breach by our general partner of any duties it may owe us or our unitholders. In addition, the board of directors of our general partner has an audit committee, that complies with the NYSE requirements or the Audit Committee, and a compensation committee of the board of directors, or the Compensation Committee.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Even though most companies listed on the NYSE are required to have a majority of independent directors serving on the board of directors of the listed company, the NYSE does not require a listed limited partnership like us to have a majority of independent directors on the board of directors of its general partner.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Our general partner has adopted a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, or Code of Ethics, that applies to the directors, officers and employees of our general partner.

Mr. Diffendal resigned from the Audit Committee when the final independent director was appointed. Thereafter, our general partner is generally required to have at least three independent directors serving on its board at all times. The board of directors of our general partner has determined that Gerald A. Tywoniuk is an audit committee financial expert. Gerald A.

Mr. Tywoniuk holds a Bachelor of Commerce degree from The University of Alberta, Canada, and is a Canadian chartered accountant. He currently serves as a director and audit committee chairperson on the board of the general partner of Oxford Resource Partners, LP (NYSE:OXF). Mr. Tywoniuk has 31 years of experience in accounting and finance, including 12 years as the Chief Financial Officer of three public companies and four years as Vice President/Controller of a fourth public company. Mr. Tywoniuk’s extensive accounting, financial and executive management experience, and his prior experience with publicly traded partnerships, provide him with the necessary skills to be a member of the board of directors of our general partner and a member and the chairman of the Audit Committee. With respect to the Audit Committee, he also qualifies as an “audit committee financial expert.”</p><p class="s6" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Section 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act requires our general partner’s board of directors and executive officers, and persons who own more than 10% of a registered class of our equity securities, to file with the SEC, and any exchange or other system on which such securities are traded or quoted, initial reports of ownership and reports of changes in ownership of our common units and other equity securities. Officers, directors and greater than 10 percent unitholders are required by the SEC’s regulations to furnish to us and any exchange or other system on which such securities are traded or quoted with copies of all Section 16(a) forms they file with the SEC.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">To our knowledge, based solely on a review of the copies of such reports furnished to us and written representations that no other reports were required, we believe that all reporting obligations of our general partner’s officers, directors and greater than 10 percent unitholders under Section 16(a) were satisfied during the year ended December 31, 2012, except as discussed below.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">L.

Executive Compensation</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Our general partner, under the direction of its board of directors, or the Board, is responsible for managing our operations and employs all of the employees that operate our business. The compensation payable to the officers of our general partner is paid by our general partner and such payments are reimbursed by us on a dollar-for-dollar basis.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The following is a discussion of the compensation policies and decisions of the Compensation Committee of the Board, with respect to the following individuals, who are executive officers of our general partner and referred to as the “named executive officers” for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011:</p><ul id="l46"><li style="padding-left: 37pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">Brian F.

Mathews, Secretary, General Counsel and Vice President of Legal Affairs</p></li></ul><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Our compensation program is designed to recruit and retain as executive officers individuals with the highest capacity to develop, grow and manage our business, and to align their compensation with our short-term and long-term goals. To do this, our compensation program for executive officers is made up of the following main components: (i) base salary, designed to compensate our executive officers for work performed during the fiscal year; (ii) short-term incentive programs, designed to reward our executive officers for our yearly performance and for their individual performances during the fiscal year; and (iii) equity-based awards, meant to align our executive officers’ interests with our long-term performance.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">This section should be read together with the compensation tables that follow, which disclose the compensation awarded to, earned by or paid to the named executive officers with respect to the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Role of the Board, the Compensation Committee and Management</h4><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The Board has appointed the Compensation Committee to assist the Board in discharging its responsibilities relating to compensation matters, including matters relating to compensation programs for directors and executive officers of the general partner. The Compensation Committee has overall responsibility for evaluating and approving our compensation plans, policies and programs, setting the compensation and benefits of executive officers, and granting awards under and administering our equity compensation plans. The Compensation Committee is charged with, among other things, establishing compensation practices and programs that are (i) designed to attract, retain and motivate exceptional leaders,</p><ol id="l47"><li style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: -14pt;text-align: justify;"><p style="display: inline;">structured to align compensation with our</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">86</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="776" height="2" alt="image" src="NYSE_AMID_2012/Image_152.png"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">overall performance and growth in distributions to unitholders, (iii) implemented to promote achievement of short-term and long-term business objectives consistent with our strategic plans, and (iv) applied to reward performance.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">As described in further detail below under “— Elements of the Compensation Programs,” the compensation programs for our executive officers consist of base salaries, annual incentive bonuses and awards under the American Midstream GP, LLC Long-Term Incentive Plan, which we refer to as our LTIP, currently in the form of equity-based phantom units, as well as other customary employment benefits such as a 401(k) plan and health and welfare benefits. We expect that total compensation of our executive officers and the components and allocation among components of their annual compensation will be reviewed on at least an annual basis by the Compensation Committee.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">During 2012 and 2011, the Compensation Committee discussed executive compensation issues at several meetings, and the Compensation Committee expects to hold additional executive compensation-related meetings in 2013 and in future years. Topics discussed and to be discussed at these meetings included and will include, among other things, (i) assessing the performance of the Chief Executive Officer, or the CEO, and other executive officers with respect to our results for the prior year, (ii) reviewing and assessing the personal performance of the executive officers for the preceding year and (iii) determining the amount of the bonus pool to be paid to our executive officers for a given year after taking into account the target bonus amounts established for those executive officers at the outset of the year. In addition, at these meetings, and after taking into account the recommendations of our CEO only with respect to executive officers other than our CEO, base salary levels and target bonus amounts (representing the bonus that may be awarded expressed as a dollar amount or as a percentage of base salary for the year) for all of our executive officers will be established by the Compensation Committee. In addition, the Compensation Committee will make its decisions with respect to any awards under the LTIP. We expect that our CEO will provide periodic recommendations to the Compensation Committee regarding the performance and compensation of the other named executive officers.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Compensation Objectives and Methodology</h4><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The principal objective of our executive compensation program is to attract and retain individuals of demonstrated competence, experience and leadership who share our business aspirations, values, ethics and culture. A further objective is to provide incentives to and reward our executive officers and other key employees for positive contributions to our business and operations, and to align their interests with our unitholders’ interests.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">In setting our compensation programs, we consider the following objectives:</p><ul id="l48"><li style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 37pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">to create unitholder value through sustainable earnings and cash available for distribution;</p></li><li style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 37pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">to provide a significant percentage of total compensation that is “at-risk” or variable;</p></li><li style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 37pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">to encourage significant equity holdings to align the interests of executive officers and other key employees with those of unitholders;</p></li><li style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 37pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">to provide competitive, performance-based compensation programs that allow us to attract and retain superior talent; and</p></li><li style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 37pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">to develop a strong linkage between business performance, safety, environmental stewardship, cooperation and executive compensation.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Taking account of the foregoing objectives, we structure total compensation for our executives to provide a guaranteed amount of cash compensation in the form of competitive base salaries, while also providing a meaningful amount of annual cash compensation that is at risk and dependent on our performance and individual performances of the executives, in the form of discretionary annual bonuses. We also seek to provide a portion of total compensation in the form of equity-based awards under our LTIP, in order to align the interests of executives and other key employees with those of our unitholders and for retention purposes. Historically, we have not made regular annual grants of awards under our LTIP. To date, the only awards under our LTIP were made in connection with our formation, although certain of these grants were made in 2010. Going forward, we expect that equity-based awards will be made more regularly and that equity-based awards will become more prominent in our annual compensation decision-making process.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Compensation decisions for individual executive officers are the result of the subjective analysis of a number of factors, including the individual executive officer’s experience, skills or tenure with us and changes to the individual executive officer’s position. In evaluating the contributions of executive officers and our performance, although no pre-determined numerical goals were established, a variety of financial measures have been generally considered, including non-GAAP financial measures used by management to assess our financial performance, such as adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distribution. For a definition of adjusted EBITDA, please read For a definition of adjusted EBITDA and a reconciliation to its most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP and a discussion of how we use adjusted EBITDA to evaluate our operating performance, please read “Management’s Discussion and Analysis —How We Evaluate Our Operations”. In addition, a variety of factors related to the individual performance of the executive officer were taken into consideration.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">In making individual compensation decisions, the Compensation Committee historically has not relied on pre-determined performance goals or targets. Instead, determinations regarding compensation have been the result of the exercise of judgment</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">87</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="776" height="2" alt="image" src="NYSE_AMID_2012/Image_153.png"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">based on all reasonably available information and, to that extent, were discretionary. Each executive officer’s current and prior compensation is considered in setting future compensation. The amount of each executive officer’s current compensation will be considered as a base against which determinations are made as to whether increases are appropriate to retain the executive officer in light of competition or in order to provide continuing performance incentives. Subject to the provisions contained in the executive officer’s employment agreement, if any, the Compensation Committee has discretion to adjust any of the components of compensation to achieve our goal of recruiting, promoting and retaining as executive officers, individuals with the skills necessary to execute our business strategy and develop, grow and manage our business.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">To date, we have not reviewed executive compensation against a specific group of comparable companies or publicly traded partnerships. Rather, the Compensation Committee has historically relied upon the judgment and industry experience of its members in making decisions with respect to total compensation and with respect to the allocation of total compensation among our three main components of compensation. Going forward, we expect that the Compensation Committee will make compensation decisions taking into account trends occurring within our industry, including from a peer group of companies, which we expect will include the following similar publicly traded partnerships: Boardwalk Pipeline Partners, LP, Regency Energy Partners LP, Targa Resources Partners LP, MarkWest Energy Partners LP, Copano Energy LLC, Crosstex Energy LP, and Atlas Pipeline Partners LP. Additionally, we expect that the Compensation Committee will take into account trends occurring within a group of publicly traded energy companies with market capitalizations in the same range as our own, including from a peer group of companies, which we expect will include the following similar publicly-traded energy companies: Contango Oil &amp; Gas Co., Goodrich Petroleum Corp., Kodiak Oil &amp; Gas Corp., Magnum Hunter Resources Corp., Penn Virginia Corp., Resolute Energy Corporation, Approach Resources, Inc., PetroQuest Energy Inc. and Rex Energy Corporation. To date, the Compensation Committee has not retained the services of any compensation consultants.</p><h4 style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Elements of the Compensation Programs</h4><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Overall, the executive officer compensation programs are designed to be consistent with the philosophy and objectives set forth above. The principal elements of our executive officer compensation programs are summarized in the table below, followed by a more detailed discussion of each compensation element.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s11" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Element Characteristics Purpose</p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 223pt;text-indent: -215pt;text-align: left;">Base Salaries Fixed annual cash compensation. Executive officers are eligible for periodic increases in base salaries. Increases may be based on performance or such other factors as the Compensation Committee may determine.</p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Keep our annual compensation competitive with the defined market for skills and experience necessary to execute our business strategy.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 223pt;text-indent: -215pt;text-align: left;">Annual Incentive Bonuses Performance-related annual cash incentives earned based on our objectives and individual performance of the executive officers. We expect that trends for our peer group will be taken into account in setting future annual cash incentive awards for our executive officers.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Align performance to our objectives that drive our business and reward executive officers for achieving our yearly performance objectives and for their individual contributions to that objective during the fiscal year.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">88</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 2pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="776" height="2" alt="image" src="NYSE_AMID_2012/Image_154.png"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Equity-Based Awards (Phantom-units and Distribution Equivalent Rights)</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Performance-related, equity-based awards granted at the discretion of the Compensation Committee. Awards are based on our performance and we expect that, going forward, will take into account competitive practices at peer companies. Grants typically consist of phantom units that vest ratably over four years and may be settled upon vesting with either a net cash payment or an issuance of common units, at the discretion of the Board. Historically, the Board has issued common units upon vesting of phantom units. Distribution Equivalent Rights, or DERs, which have been granted in conjunction with such phantom unit awards, entitle the grantee to receive cash distributions on unvested LTIP awards to the same extent generally as unitholders receive cash distributions on our common units.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Align interests of executive officers with unitholders and motivate and reward executive officers to increase unitholder value over the long term. Ratable vesting over a four-year period is designed to facilitate retention of executive officers. Issuance of common units upon vesting encourages equity ownership in order to align interests of executive officers with those of unitholders. DERs provide a clear, objective link between growing distributions to unitholders and executive compensation.

At our formation, we adopted and are maintaining a tax-deferred or after-tax 401(k) plan in which all eligible employees can elect to defer compensation for retirement up to IRS imposed limits. The 401(k) plan permits us to make annual discretionary matching contributions to the plan. For 2010, we matched employee contributions to 401(k) plan accounts up to a maximum employer contribution of 6% of the employee’s eligible compensation.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Provide our executive officers and other employees with the opportunity to save for their future retirement.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 223pt;text-indent: -215pt;text-align: left;">Health and Welfare Benefits Health and welfare benefits (medical, dental, vision, disability insurance and life insurance) are available for our executive officers and all other regular full-time employees.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Provide benefits to meet the health and wellness needs of our executive officers and other employees and their families.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 36pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">(1) On June 9, 2011, we amended each of the outstanding phantom unit grant agreements with our named executive officers to eliminate the DERs previously granted with our phantom units in exchange for a one-time aggregate payment of approximately $1.0 million. We do not expect to use grants of DERs as an element of our compensation programs in the future.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Base Salaries</h4><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Base salaries for our executive officers will be determined annually by an assessment of our overall financial and operating performance, each executive officer’s performance evaluation and changes in executive officer responsibilities. While many aspects of performance can be measured in financial terms, senior management will also be evaluated in areas of performance that are more subjective. These areas include the development and execution of strategic plans, the exercise of leadership in the development of management and other employees, innovation and improvement in our business activities and each executive officer’s involvement in industry groups and in the communities that we serve. We seek to compensate executive officers for their performance throughout the year with annual base salaries that are fair and competitive within our marketplace. We believe that executive officer base salaries should be competitive with salaries for executive officers in similar positions and with similar responsibilities in our marketplace and adjusted for financial and operating performance and each executive officer’s performance evaluation, length of service with us and previous work experience. Individual salaries have historically been established by the</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">89</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="776" height="2" alt="image" src="NYSE_AMID_2012/Image_155.png"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Compensation Committee based on the general industry knowledge and experience of its members, in alignment with these considerations, to ensure the attraction, development and retention of superior talent. Going forward, we expect that determinations will continue to focus on the above considerations and will also take into account relevant market data, including data from our peer group.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">We expect that base salaries will be reviewed annually to ensure continuing consistency with market levels and our level of financial performance during the previous year. Future adjustments to base salaries and salary ranges will reflect movement in the competitive market as well as individual performance. Annual base salary adjustments, if any, for the CEO will be determined by the Compensation Committee. Annual base salary adjustments, if any, for the other executive officers will be determined by the Compensation Committee, taking into account input from the CEO.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">On June 9, 2011, we entered into new employment agreements with each of our named executive officers (with the exception of Mr. Campbell), which agreements were effective upon the completion of our initial public offering. In connection with approving the new employment agreements, the Compensation Committee approved base salary increases for 2012 for the named executive officers as provided in the table below.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><table style="border-collapse:collapse;margin-left:7pt" cellspacing="0"><tr style="height:20pt"><td style="width:494pt"><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s21" style="padding-left: 1pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Name</p></td><td style="width:88pt;border-bottom-style:solid;border-bottom-width:1pt"><p class="s21" style="padding-left: 12pt;padding-right: 12pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 9pt;text-align: center;">Base Salary</p><p class="s21" style="padding-left: 12pt;padding-right: 12pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 9pt;text-align: center;">at the end of 2012</p></td></tr><tr style="height:14pt"><td style="width:494pt"><p class="s15" style="padding-left: 1pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Brian F.

Annual cash incentive awards, if any, for the CEO are determined by the Compensation Committee. Annual cash incentive awards, if any, for the other executive officers are determined by the Compensation Committee taking into account input from the CEO.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">We expect to review annual cash bonus awards for the named executive officers annually to determine award payments for the prior fiscal year, as well as to establish target bonus amounts for the current fiscal year. At the beginning of each year, the Compensation Committee meets with the CEO to discuss partnership and individual goals for the year and what each executive is expected to contribute in order to help the partnership achieve those goals. However, the amounts of the annual bonuses have been and are determined in the discretion of the Compensation Committee.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">While target bonuses for our executive officers who have entered into employment agreements have been initially set at dollar amounts that are 25% to 100% of their base salaries, the Compensation Committee has had broad discretion to retain, reduce or increase the award amounts when making its final bonus determinations. Bonuses (similar to other elements of the compensation provided to executive officers) historically have not been solely based on a prescribed formula or pre-determined goals or specified performance targets but rather have been determined on a discretionary basis and generally have been based on a subjective evaluation of individual, company-wide and industry performances. Target bonus amounts for 2011 for all of the executive officers, which are specified in their new employment agreements, are set forth in the table below. Please refer to “— New Employment Agreements with Named Executive Officers” below for a description of the new employment agreements.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The Board and the Compensation Committee believed that this approach to assessing performance resulted in a more comprehensive evaluation for compensation decisions. In 2011, the Compensation Committee recognized the following factors in making discretionary annual bonus recommendations and determinations:</p></li><li style="padding-left: 37pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">a subjective performance evaluation based on company-wide financial and individual qualitative performance, as determined in the Compensation Committee’s discretion; and</p></li><li style="padding-left: 37pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">the scope, level of expertise and experience required for the executive officer’s position.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">These factors were selected as the most appropriate measures upon which to base the annual incentive cash bonus decisions because our Compensation Committee believed that they help to align individual compensation with performance and contribution.

In adopting the LTIP, the Board recognized that it needed a source of equity to attract new members to and retain members of the management team, as well as to provide an equity incentive to other key employees and non-employee directors. We believe the LTIP promotes a long-term focus on results and aligns executive and unitholder interests. As part of</span></h4><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">this initial formation, we granted phantom units with associated DERs to provide long-term incentives to our named executive officers. DERs enabled the recipients of phantom unit awards to receive cash distributions on our phantom units to the same extent generally as unitholders receive cash distributions on our common units. In June 2011, existing LTIP grant agreements with the named executive officers and certain board members were modified to exclude the DER</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">91</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 2pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="764" height="2" alt="image" src="NYSE_AMID_2012/Image_157.png"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">provision in exchange for a cash payment of $1.3 million. The Compensation Committee does not expect to utilize the DER provision in future LTIP grants.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The LTIP is designed to encourage responsible and profitable growth while taking into account non-routine factors that may be integral to our success. Long-term incentive compensation in the form of equity grants are used to provide incentives for performance that leads to enhanced unitholder value, encourage retention and closely align the executive officers’ interests with unitholders’ interests. Equity grants provide a vital link between the long-term results achieved for our unitholders and the rewards provided to executive officers and other key employees.</p><h4 style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Phantom Units. <span class="p">The only awards made under the LTIP since its adoption have been phantom units. A phantom unit is a notional unit granted under the LTIP that entitles the holder to receive an amount of cash equal to the fair market value of one common unit upon vesting of the phantom unit, unless the Board elects to pay such vested phantom unit with a common unit in lieu of cash. Historically, our Board has always</span></h4><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">issued common units instead of cash. Unless an individual award agreement provides otherwise, the LTIP provides that unvested phantom units are forfeited at the time the holder terminates employment or board membership, as applicable. The terms of the award agreements of our named executive officers provide that a termination due to death or disability results in full acceleration of vesting. In general, phantom units awarded under our LTIP vest as to 25% of the award on each of the first four anniversaries of the date of grant. Currently outstanding awards are phantom units without DER’s.</p><h4 style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Equity-Based Award Policies. <span class="p">Prior to 2011, equity-based awards were granted by the Compensation Committee in connection with our formation. Going forward, we expect that equity-based awards will be awarded by the Compensation Committee on an annual basis as part of the ongoing total annual compensation package for executive officers. No named executive officers received any awards under the LTIP in 2012</span></h4><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">or 2011, other than Mr. Campbell upon his employment in April 2012.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Deferred Compensation</h4><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Tax-qualified retirement plans are a common way that companies assist employees in preparing for retirement. We provide our eligible executive officers and other employees with an opportunity to save for their retirement by participating in our 401(k) savings plan. The 401(k) plan allows executive officers and other employees to defer compensation (up to IRS imposed limits) for retirement and permits us to make annual discretionary matching contributions to the plan. For 2012, we matched employee contributions to 401(k) plan accounts up to a maximum employer contribution of 6% of the employee’s eligible compensation. Decisions regarding this element of compensation do not impact any other element of compensation.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Other Benefits</h4><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Each of the named executive officers is eligible to participate in our employee benefit plans which provide for medical, dental, vision, disability insurance and life insurance benefits, which are provided on the same terms as available generally to all salaried employees. In 2012 and 2011, no perquisites were provided to the named executive officers.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Recoupment Policy</h4><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">We currently do not have a recoupment policy applicable to annual incentive bonuses or equity awards. The Compensation Committee expects to continue to evaluate the need to adopt such a policy in 2013, in light of current legislative policies as well as economic and market conditions.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Employment and Severance Arrangements</h4><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The Board and the Compensation Committee consider the maintenance of a sound management team to be essential to protecting and enhancing our best interests. To that end, we recognize that the uncertainty that may exist among management with respect to their “at-will” employment with our general partner may result in the departure or distraction of management personnel to our detriment. Accordingly, our general partner previously entered into employment agreements with each of Messrs. Bierbach, Campbell, Patterson, Matthews and Connor, which existing employment agreements contain severance arrangements that we believed were appropriate to encourage the continued attention and dedication of members of our management. These employment agreements are described more fully below under “— Existing Employment Agreements with Named Executive Officers.” In connection with the initial public offering, on June 9, 2011, our general partner entered into new employment agreements with each of our named executive officers to be effective upon the closing of the offering.

The base salary and target bonus amounts set forth in such employment agreements are shown in the table below. The employment agreements provide that the base salary may be increased but not decreased (except for a decrease that is consistent with reductions taken generally by other executives of the general partner).

The plan provides for the issuance of options, unit appreciation rights, restricted units, phantom units, other unit-based awards, unit awards or replacement awards, as well as tandem DERs granted with respect to an award. To date, only phantom units some with DERs, have been issued under the LTIP. Currently, outstanding awards are phantom units without DER’s.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">As of December 31, 2012, 90,937 unvested phantom units were outstanding under our LTIP. A phantom unit is a notional unit granted under the LTIP that entitles the holder to receive an amount of cash equal to the fair market value of one common unit upon vesting of the phantom unit, unless the Board elects to pay such vested phantom unit with a common unit in lieu of cash. Historically, our Board has always issued common units in lieu of cash upon vesting of a phantom unit. DERs may be granted in tandem with phantom units. Except as otherwise provided in an award agreement, DERs that are not subject to a restricted period are currently paid to the participant at the time a distribution is made to the unitholders, and DERs that are subject to a restricted period are paid to the participant in a single lump sum no later than the 15th day of the third calendar month following the date on which the restricted period ends.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The number of units that may be delivered with respect to awards under the LTIP may not exceed 920,193 units, subject to specified anti- dilution adjustments. However, if any award is terminated, cancelled, forfeited or expires for any reason without the actual delivery of units covered by such award or units are withheld from an award to satisfy the exercise price or the employer’s tax withholding obligation with respect to such award, such units will again be available for issuance pursuant to other awards granted under the LTIP. In addition, any units allocated to an award will, to the extent such award is paid in cash, be again available for delivery under the LTIP with respect to other awards. There is no limitation on the number of awards that may be granted under the LTIP and paid in cash. The LTIP provides that it is to be administered by the Board, provided that the Board may delegate authority to administer the LTIP to a committee of non-employee directors. As of March 31, 2013, there are 903,079 units available for future grant awards.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The LTIP may be terminated or amended at any time, including increasing the number of units that may be granted, subject to unitholder approval as required by the securities exchange on which the common units are listed at that time. However, no change in any outstanding grant may be made that would materially reduce the benefits of the participant without the consent of the participant. The plan will terminate on the earliest of (i) its termination by the Board or the Compensation Committee, (ii) the tenth anniversary of the date the LTIP was adopted or</p><ol id="l53"><li style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><p style="display: inline;">when units are no longer available for delivery pursuant to awards under the LTIP. Unless expressly provided for in the plan or an applicable award agreement, any award granted prior to the termination of the plan, and the authority of the Board or the Compensation Committee to amend, adjust or terminate such award or to waive any conditions or rights under such award, will extend beyond the termination date.</p></li></ol><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s6" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control</p><p class="s25" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Employment Agreements with Named Executive Officers</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The employment agreements provide for, among other things, the payment of severance benefits following certain terminations of employment by our general partner, the termination of employment for “Good Reason” (as defined below) by the executive officer, or, under certain circumstances, upon expiration of the term of the agreement. Under the employment agreements, if the executive’s employment is terminated upon expiration of the initial or extended term of the agreement by either party upon 90 days’ written notice (with certain exceptions, as described below), if the executive’s employment is terminated by the general partner other than for “Cause” (defined as defined below) or other than upon the executive’s death or disability, or if the executive resigns for Good Reason, the executive will have the right to severance in an amount equal to the sum of the executive’s annual base salary at the rate in effect on the date of termination plus the amount, if any, paid to the executive as an annual cash bonus for the calendar year ending immediately prior to the date of such termination. Such severance amount will be paid in installments (on regular pay days scheduled in accordance with our regular payroll practices) beginning on the 60th day following the termination date and ending on the one year anniversary of the termination date, and will be subject to reimbursement by us to our general partner. The foregoing severance benefit is conditioned on the executive executing a release of claims in favor of our general partner and its affiliates, including us.</p></li><li style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 25pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;"><p style="display: inline;">“Cause”: defined in each of the employment agreements as the executive having (i) engaged in gross negligence, gross incompetence or willful misconduct in the performance of the duties required of him under the employment agreement, (ii) refused without proper reason to perform the duties and responsibilities required of him under the employment agreement, (iii) willfully engaged in conduct that is materially injurious to our general partner or its affiliates including us (monetarily or otherwise), (iv) committed an act of fraud, embezzlement or willful breach of fiduciary duty to our general partner or an affiliate including us (including the unauthorized disclosure of confidential or proprietary material information of our general</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">95</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="776" height="2" alt="image" src="NYSE_AMID_2012/Image_161.png"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">partner or an affiliate including us) or (v) been convicted of (or pleaded no contest to) a crime involving fraud, dishonesty or moral turpitude or any felony.</p></li><li style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 25pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">“Good Reason”: is defined in each employment agreement as a termination by the executive in connection with or based upon (i) a material diminution in the executive’s responsibilities, duties or authority, (ii) a material diminution in the executive’s base compensation,</p><p style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">(iii) assignment of the executive to a principal office located beyond a 50-mile radius of the executive’s then current work place, or (iv) a material breach by us of any material provision of the employment agreement.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Each employment agreement also contains certain confidentiality covenants prohibiting each executive officer from, among other things, disclosing confidential information relating to our general partner or any of its affiliates, including us. The employment agreements also contain non-competition and non-solicitation restrictions, which apply during the term of the executive’s employment with our general partner and continue for a period of 12 months following termination for any reason. If the executive’s employment is terminated upon expiration of the initial or extended term of the agreement by either party upon 90 days’ written notice, the board of directors may, in its discretion, release the executive from being subject to the noncompetition covenant following termination of employment; however, in that case, the executive would not be entitled to receive any severance payment in connection with such termination.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Amended Phantom Unit Grant Agreements</h4><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Each of our named executive officers has received an award of phantom units under the LTIP.

Under the rules of the SEC, a person is deemed to be a “beneficial owner” of a security if that person has or shares “voting power,” which includes the power to vote or to direct the voting of such security, or “investment power,” which includes the power to dispose of or to direct the disposition of such security. In computing the number of common units beneficially owned by a person and the percentage ownership of that person, common units subject to options or warrants held by that person that are currently exercisable or exercisable within 60 days of April 15, 2013, if any, are deemed outstanding, but are not deemed outstanding for computing the percentage ownership of any other person. Except as indicated by footnote, the persons named in the table below have sole voting and investment power with respect to all units shown as beneficially owned by them, subject to community property laws where applicable.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">99</p><p style="text-indent:

In connection with the ArcLight Transactions, on April 15, 2013, High Point acquired those subordinated units from AIM Midstream Holdings, as well as 90% of the limited liability company interests in our general partner. As a result of these transactions and the related issuance of 5,142,857 preferred units, High Point owns a combined 69% limited partnership interest in us. In addition, High Point controls and owns 90%, and AIM Midstream Holdings owns 10%, of our general partner, which owns an approximate 2.0% general partner interest in us and all of our incentive distribution rights.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s6" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Distributions and Payments to our General Partner and its Affiliates</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The following summarizes the distributions and payments to be made by us to our general partner and its affiliates in connection with our formation, ongoing operation and any liquidation of American Midstream Partners, LP. These distributions and payments were determined by and among affiliated entities and, consequently, are not the result of arm’s-length negotiations.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s25" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Distributions of available cash to our general partner and its affiliates:</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">We will initially make cash distributions 98.0% to our unitholders pro rata, including AIM Midstream Holdings, as the holder of an aggregate of 725,120 common units, and High Point, as the holder of 4,526,066 subordinated units and 5,142,857 preferred units, and an approximate 2.0% to our general partner, assuming it makes any capital contributions necessary to maintain its an approximate 2.0% general partner interest in us. In addition, if distributions exceed the minimum quarterly distribution and target distribution levels, the incentive distribution rights held by our general partner will entitle our general partner to increasing percentages of the distributions, up to 48.0% of the distributions above the highest target distribution level.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Assuming we have sufficient available cash to pay the full minimum quarterly distribution on all of our outstanding units for four quarters, our general partner and its affiliates would receive an annual distribution of approximately $0.3 million on its an approximate 2.0% general partner interest and AIM Midstream Holdings would receive an annual distribution of approximately $1.3 million on its common units. Initially following the ArcLight Transactions, High Point would receive an annual distribution of approximately 302.5 additional preferred units and approximately $13.1 million in respect of its subordinated units and preferred units. Assuming the PIK Distribution ceases with the quarter ending September 30, 2014 and no conversion of preferred units, under the terms of our Third Amended and Restated Agreement of Limited Partnership, High Point would receive an annual distribution of approximately $17.5 million in respect of its subordinated and preferred units.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s25" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Payments to our general partner and its affiliates</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Our general partner will not receive a management fee or other compensation for its management of us.

The consolidated financial statements present fairly the Partnership’s financial position, results of operations and cash flows in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. In preparing its consolidated financial statements, the Partnership includes amounts that are based on estimates and judgments that Management believes are reasonable under the circumstances. The Partnership’s financial statements have been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm appointed by the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. Management has made available to PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP all of the Partnership’s financial records and related data, as well as the minutes of the Directors’ meetings.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s6" style="padding-left: 94pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">MANAGEMENT&#39;S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Management of our general partner is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f). The Partnership’s internal control system was designed to provide reasonable assurance to the Partnership’s Management and Directors regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Management assessed the effectiveness of the Partnership’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2012. This assessment was based on criteria established in <i>Internal Control — Integrated Framework </i>issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”). Management has excluded American Midstream Chatom, LLC, which represented 25% of our consolidated total assets and 12% of our consolidated total revenues, from its assessment of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2012 because it was acquired by the Partnership in a purchase business combination during 2012. Based on our assessment, we believe that as of December 31, 2012 the Partnership’s internal control over financial reporting is effective based on those criteria.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="250" height="1" alt="image" src="NYSE_AMID_2012/Image_188.png"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 43pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 129%;text-align: left;">/s/ Brian F.

These financial statements are the responsibility of the Partnership&#39;s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of American Midstream Partners, LP and its subsidiaries at December 31, 2012 and 2011, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2012 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">As discussed in Note 1 &quot;Organization and Basis of Presentation,&quot; Note 22 “Liquidity” and Note 23 “Subsequent Events” to the consolidated financial statements, subsequent to December 31, 2012, the control of the general partner has changed and the Partnership entered into a contribution agreement, an amended and restated agreement of limited partnership and amended its credit facility.</p><p

business</h4><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">American Midstream Partners, LP (the “Partnership”) was formed on August 20, 2009 (“date of inception”) as a Delaware limited partnership for the purpose of acquiring and operating certain natural gas pipeline and processing businesses. We provide natural gas gathering, treating, processing, fractionating, marketing and transportation services primarily in the Gulf Coast and Southeast regions of the United States. We hold our assets in a series of wholly owned limited liability companies as well as a limited partnership. Our capital accounts consist of general partner interests and limited partner interests.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Our interstate natural gas pipeline assets transport natural gas through the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (“FERC”) regulated interstate natural gas pipelines in Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama and Tennessee. Our interstate pipelines include:</p></li></ol></li><li style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 25pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">American Midstream (Midla), LLC, which owns and operates approximately 370 miles of interstate pipeline that runs from the Monroe gas field in northern Louisiana south through Mississippi to Baton Rouge, Louisiana.</p></li><li style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 25pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;"><p style="display: inline;">American Midstream (AlaTenn), LLC, which owns and operates approximately 295 miles of interstate pipeline that runs through the Tennessee River Valley from Selmer, Tennessee to Huntsville, Alabama and serves an eight -county area in Alabama, Mississippi and Tennessee.</p><p class="s25" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">ArcLight Transactions</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">On April 15, 2013, the Partnership, our general partner and AIM Midstream Holdings, LLC, an affiliate of American Infrastructure MLP Fund, entered into agreements (the &quot;ArcLight Transactions&quot;) with High Point Infrastructure Partners, LLC, an affiliate of ArcLight Capital Partners, LLC (“High Point”), pursuant to which High Point (i) acquired 90% of our general partner and all of our subordinated units from AIM Midstream Holdings and (ii) contributed certain midstream assets and $15.0 million in cash to us in exchange for 5,142,857 convertible preferred units (the “Series A Preferred Units”) issued by the Partnership. As a result of these transactions, which were also consummated on April 15, 2013, High Point acquired both control of our general partner and a majority of our outstanding limited partnership interests. The midstream assets contributed by High Point consist of approximately 700 miles of natural gas and liquids pipeline assets located in southeast Louisiana and the shallow water and deep shelf Gulf of Mexico. These midstream assets gather natural gas from both onshore and offshore producing regions around southeast Louisiana. The onshore footprint is Plaquemines and St. Bernard&#39;s Parish, LA. The offshore footprint consists of the following federal Gulf of Mexico zones: Mississippi Canyon, Viosca Knoll, West Delta, Main Pass, South Pass and Breton Sound. Natural gas is collected at more than 75 receipt points that connect to hundreds of wells targeting various geological zones in water depths up to 1,000 feet, with an emphasis on oil and liquids-rich reservoirs. The High Point midstream assets are comprised of FERC-regulated transmission assets and non-jurisdictional gathering assets, both of which accept natural gas from well production and interconnected pipeline systems. High Point delivers the natural gas to the Toca Gas Processing Plant, operated by Enterprise, where the products are processed and the residue gas sent to an unaffiliated interstate system owned by Kinder Morgan. See Note 23 &quot; Subsequent Events&quot; for further information.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">We depend on our June 2012 amended credit facility for future capital needs and may use it to fund a portion of cash distributions to unitholders, as necessary, depending on the level of our operating cashflow. The Partnership believes that the consummation of the ArcLight Transactions will allow it to maintain compliance with the Consolidated Total Leverage to EBTIDA ratio in the Fourth Amendment to our June 2012 amended credit agreement (&quot;Fourth Amendment&quot;) for a period of at least the next twelve months from the date of the Annual Report on Form 10-K. However, no assurances can be given that the ArcLight Transactions will achieve the necessary ratios or that the contributed business can yield the necessary cash flows. If the foregoing does not occur and we are not able to generate sufficient cash flows from operations to maintain compliance with the financial covenants in the Fourth Amendment and we are not able enter into an agreement to refinance or obtain covenant default waivers the debt could become due and payable upon acceleration by the lenders in our banking group and other agreements with cross- default provisions could become due. In addition, failure to comply with any of the covenants under our Fourth Amendment could adversely affect our ability to fund ongoing operations and growth capital requirements as well as our ability to pay distributions to our unitholders. See Note 22 &quot; Liquidity&quot; for further information.</p><h4 style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Basis of presentation</h4><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The accompanying financial statements and related notes present our consolidated financial position as of December 31, 2012 and 2011, and results of operations, comprehensive income, changes in partners&#39; capital and noncontrolling interest, and cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">We have prepared the consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”). The accompanying consolidated financial statements include accounts of American Midstream</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">F-10</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="776" height="2" alt="image" src="NYSE_AMID_2012/Image_213.png"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Partners, LP and its controlled subsidiaries. All significant inter-company accounts and transactions have been eliminated in the preparation of the accompanying consolidated financial statements. We have made reclassifications to amounts reported in prior period consolidated financial statements to conform with current year presentation. These reclassifications did not have an impact on net income for the period previously reported.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The results of operations for acquisitions accounted for as business combinations have been included in the consolidated financial statements since their respective acquisition dates (see Note 2).</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Consolidation policy</h4><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Our consolidated financial statements include our accounts and those of our subsidiaries in which we have a controlling interest. We hold an undivided interest in the Burns Point gas processing facility in which we are responsible for our proportionate share of the costs and expenses of the facility. Our consolidated financial statements reflect our proportionate share of the revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities of this undivided interest. In July 2012, the Partnership acquired a 87.4% undivided interest in the Chatom Processing and Fractionation facility (the &quot;Chatom system&quot;). Our consolidated financial statements reflect the accounts of the Chatom system since acquisition, and the interests in the Chatom system held by non-affiliated working interest owners are reflected as noncontrolling interests in the Partnership&#39;s consolidated financial statements.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Use of estimates</h4><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">When preparing financial statements in conformity with GAAP, management must make estimates and assumptions based on information available at the time. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, as well as the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements. Estimates and judgments are based on information available at the time such estimates and judgments are made. Adjustments made with respect to the use of these estimates and judgments often relate to information not previously available. Uncertainties with respect to such estimates and judgments are inherent in the preparation of financial statements. Estimates and judgments are used in, among other things (1) estimating unbilled revenues, product purchases and operating and general and administrative costs, (2) developing fair value assumptions, including estimates of future cash flows and discount rates,</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">(3) analyzing long-lived assets for possible impairment, (4) estimating the useful lives of assets and (5) determining amounts to accrue for contingencies, guarantees and indemnifications. Actual results, therefore, could differ materially from estimated amounts.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Accounting for regulated operations</h4><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Certain of our natural gas pipelines are subject to regulations by FERC. FERC exercises statutory authority over matters such as construction, transportation rates we charge and our underlying accounting practices and ratemaking agreements with customers. Accordingly, we record costs that are allowed in the ratemaking process in a period different from the period in which the costs would be charged to expense by a non- regulated entity. Also, we record assets and liabilities that result from the regulated ratemaking process that would be recorded under GAAP for our regulated entities. As of December 31, 2012 and 2011 , we had no such material regulatory assets or liabilities.</p><h4 style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Revenue recognition and the estimation of revenues and cost of purchases</h4><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">We recognize revenue when all of the following criteria are met: (1) persuasive evidence of an exchange arrangement exists, (2) delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, (3) the price is fixed or determinable, and (4) collectability is reasonably assured. We record revenue and cost of product sold on a gross basis for those transactions where we act as the principal and take title to natural gas, natural gas liquids (&quot;NGLs&quot;) or condensates that are purchased for resale. When our customers pay us a fee for providing a service such as gathering, treating or transportation, we record those fees separately in revenues. We have the following arrangements:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s38" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Fee-based</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Under these arrangements, we generally are paid a fixed fee for gathering and transporting natural gas. Fee-based revenues, which are included in sales of natural gas, NGLs and condensate, are recorded when services have been provided, and collectability of the revenue is reasonably assured.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s38" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Percent-of-proceeds, or POP</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Under these arrangements, we generally gather raw natural gas from producers at the wellhead or other supply points, transport it through our gathering system, process it and sell the residue natural gas and NGLs at market prices. Where we provide processing services at the processing plants that we own, or obtain processing service for our own account under our own elective processing arrangements we typically retain and sell a percentage of the residue natural gas and resulting NGLs. We recognize percent-of-proceeds contract revenue, which is included in sales of natural gas, NGLs and condensate, when the natural gas, NGLs or</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">F-11</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 2pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="776" height="2" alt="image" src="NYSE_AMID_2012/Image_214.png"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">condensate is sold to a purchaser at a fixed or determinable price, delivery has occurred and title has transferred, and collectability of the revenue is reasonably assured.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s38" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Fixed-margin</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Under these arrangements, we purchase natural gas from producers or suppliers at receipt points on our systems at an index price less a fixed transportation fee and simultaneously sell an identical volume of natural gas at delivery points on our systems at the same, undiscounted index price. We recognize revenue from fixed-margin contracts, which is included in sales of natural gas, NGLs and condensate, when the natural gas is sold to a purchaser at a fixed or determinable price, delivery has occurred and title has transferred and collectability of the revenue is reasonably assured.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s38" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Firm transportation</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Under arrangements to provide firm transportation service, we are obligated to transport natural gas nominated by the shipper up to the maximum daily quantity specified in the contract. In exchange for that obligation on our part, the shipper pays a specified reservation charge, whether or not they utilize the capacity. In most cases, the shipper also pays a variable use charge with respect to quantities actually transported by us. Firm transportation revenue is recorded when products are delivered, services have been provided and collectability of the revenue is reasonably assured.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s38" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Interruptible transportation</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Under arrangements to provide interruptible transportation service, we are only obligated to transport natural gas nominated by the shipper to the extent we have available capacity. For this service the shipper pays no reservation charge but pays a variable use charge for quantities actually shipped. Interruptible transportation revenue is recorded when products are delivered, services have been provided and collectability of revenue is reasonably assured.</p><p class="s38" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Interest in the Burns Point Plant</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">We account for our interest in the Burns Point Plant using the proportionate consolidation method. Under this method, we include in our consolidated statement of operations our value of plant revenues taken in-kind and plant expenses reimbursed to the operator.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Cash and cash equivalents</h4><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">We consider all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase to be cash equivalents. The carrying value of cash and cash equivalents approximates fair value because of the short term to maturity of these investments.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Allowance for doubtful accounts</h4><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">We establish provisions for losses on accounts receivable when we determine that we will not collect all or part of an outstanding balance. Collectability is reviewed regularly and an allowance is established or adjusted, as necessary, using the specific identification method. As of December 31, 2012 and 2011 , the Partnership recorded no allowances for losses on accounts receivable.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Inventory</h4><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Inventory includes NGL product inventory. The Partnership records all product inventories at the lower of cost or market (“LCM”), which is determined on a weighted average basis and included within Other current assets on the consolidated balance sheets.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Operational balancing agreements and natural gas imbalances</h4><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">To facilitate deliveries of natural gas and provide for operational flexibility, we have operational balancing agreements in place with other interconnecting pipelines. These agreements ensure that the volume of natural gas a shipper schedules for transportation between two interconnecting pipelines equals the volume actually delivered. If natural gas moves between pipelines in volumes that are more or less than the volumes the shipper previously scheduled, a natural gas imbalance is created. The imbalances are settled through periodic cash payments or repaid in-kind through future receipt or delivery of natural gas. Natural gas imbalances are recorded as gas imbalances and classified within other current assets or other current liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets based on the market value.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Property, plant and equipment</h4><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">We capitalize expenditures related to property, plant and equipment that have a useful life greater than one year for (1) assets purchased or constructed; (2) existing assets that are replaced, improved, or the useful lives of which have been extended; and</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">F-12</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="776" height="2" alt="image" src="NYSE_AMID_2012/Image_215.png"/></span></p><ol id="l69"><li style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: -14pt;text-align: justify;"><p style="display: inline;">all land, regardless of cost. Maintenance and repair costs, including any planned major maintenance activities, are expensed as incurred.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">We record property, plant, and equipment at its original cost, which we depreciate on a straight-line basis over its estimated useful life. Our determination of the useful lives of property, plant and equipment requires us to make various assumptions, including the supply of and demand for hydrocarbons in the markets served by our assets, normal wear and tear of the facilities, and the extent and frequency of maintenance programs. We record depreciation using the group method of depreciation, which is commonly used by pipelines, utilities and similar assets.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The Partnership calculated the fair value of net assets acquired from Quantum Resources Management, LLC in July 2012 with the assistance of an independent third party valuation firm. These valuations were performed primarily using a discounted cash flow model that included certain market assumptions related to future throughput discount rates. We created the projections and reviewed the calculations, assumptions and valuation methodology used to determine the fair value of the assets acquired. We determined the final fair values to assign to the assets and liabilities in determining the purchase price allocation and had sole responsibility for those items in the financial statements.</p><h4 style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Impairment of long lived Assets</h4><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">We evaluate the recoverability of our property, plant and equipment when events or circumstances such as economic obsolescence, business climate, legal and other factors indicate we may not recover the carrying amount of the assets. We continually monitor our business, the market, and business environment to identify indicators that could suggest an asset may not be recoverable. We evaluate the asset for recoverability by estimating the undiscounted future cash flows expected to be derived from operating the asset as a going concern. These cash flow estimates require us to make projections and assumptions for many years into the future for pricing, demand, competition, operating cost, contract renewals, and other factors. We recognize an impairment loss when the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value as determined by quoted market prices in active markets or present value techniques. The determination of the fair value using present value techniques requires us to make projections and assumptions regarding future cash flows and weighted average cost of capital. Any changes we make to these projections and assumptions could result in significant revisions to our evaluation of the recoverability of our property, plant and equipment and the recognition of an impairment loss in our consolidated statements of income. No impairment losses were recognized during the years ended December 31, 2012 , 2011 and 2010 .</p><h4 style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Income taxes</h4><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">We are not a taxable entity for U.S. federal income tax purposes or for the majority of states that impose an income tax. Taxes on our net income generally are borne by our unitholders through the allocation of taxable income. Our tax expense results from the enactment of state income tax laws by the State of Texas that apply to entities organized as partnerships and is included in selling, general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations. The Texas margin tax is computed on our modified gross margin and was not significant for each of the years ended December 31, 2012 , 2011 and 2010 .</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Net income for financial statement purposes may differ significantly from taxable income allocable to unitholders as a result of differences between the tax basis and financial reporting basis of assets and liabilities and the taxable income allocation requirement under our partnership agreement. The aggregate difference in the basis of our net assets for financial and tax reporting purposes cannot be readily determined because information regarding each partner’s tax attributes in us is not available.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Commitments, contingencies and environmental liabilities</h4><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">We expense or capitalize, as appropriate, expenditures for ongoing compliance with environmental regulations that relate to past or current operations. We expense amounts we incur from the remediation of existing environmental contamination caused by past operations that do not benefit future period by preventing or eliminating future contamination. We record liabilities for environmental matters when assessments indicate that remediation efforts are probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated. Estimates of environmental liabilities are based on currently available facts, existing technology and presently enacted laws and regulation taking into consideration the likely effects of inflation and other factors. These amounts also take into account our prior experience in remediating contaminated sites, other companies’ clean-up experience and data released by government organizations. Our estimates are subject to revision in future periods based on actual cost or new information. We evaluate recoveries from insurance coverage separately from the liability and, when recovery is probable, we record an asset separately from the associated liability in our consolidated financial statements.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">We recognize liabilities for other commitments and contingencies when, after fully analyzing the available information, we determine it is either probable that an asset has been impaired or that a liability has been incurred and the amount of impairment or loss can be reasonably estimated. When a range of probable loss can be estimated, we accrue the most likely amount or if no amount in more likely than another, we accrue the minimum of the range of probable loss. We expense legal costs associated with loss contingencies as such costs are incurred.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">F-13</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 2pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="776" height="2" alt="image" src="NYSE_AMID_2012/Image_216.png"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">We have legal obligations requiring us to decommission our offshore pipeline systems at retirement. In certain rate jurisdictions, we are permitted to include annual charges for removal costs in the regulated cost of service rates we charge our customers. Additionally, legal obligations exist for a minority of our offshore right-of-way agreements due to requirements or landowner options to compel us to remove the pipe at final abandonment. Sufficient data exists with certain onshore pipeline systems to reasonably estimate the cost of abandoning or retiring a pipeline system. However, in some cases, there is insufficient information to reasonably determine the timing and/or method of settlement of estimating the fair value of the asset retirement obligation. In these cases, the asset retirement obligation cost is considered indeterminate because there is no data or information that can be derived from past practice, industry practice, management’s experience, or the asset’s estimated economic life. The useful lives  of most pipeline systems are primarily derived from available supply resources and ultimate consumption of those resources by end users. Variables can affect the remaining lives of the assets which preclude us from making a reasonable estimate of the asset retirement obligation. Indeterminate asset retirement obligation costs will be recognized in the period in which sufficient information exist to reasonably estimate potential settlement dates and methods.</p><h4 style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Asset retirement obligations (“AROs”)</h4><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">AROs are legal obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets that result from the asset’s acquisition, construction, development and/or normal operation. An ARO is initially measured at its estimated fair value. Upon initial recognition of an ARO, we record an increase to the carrying amount of the related long-lived asset and an offsetting ARO liability. We depreciate the capitalized ARO using the straight-line method over the period during which the related long-lived asset is expected to provide benefits. After the initial period of ARO recognition, we revise the ARO to reflect the passage of time or revisions to the amount of estimated cash flows or their timing.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Derivative financial instruments</h4><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Our net income and cash flows are subject to volatility stemming from changes in interest rates on our variable rate debt, commodity prices and fractionation margins (the relative difference between the price we receive from NGL sales and the corresponding cost of natural gas purchases). In an effort to manage the risks to unitholders, we use a variety of derivative financial instruments including swaps, put options and interest rate caps to create offsetting positions to specific commodity or interest rate exposures. In accordance with the authoritative accounting guidance, we record all derivative financial instruments in our consolidated balance sheets at fair market value. We record the fair market value of our derivative financial instruments in the consolidated balance sheet as current and long-term assets or liabilities on a net basis by counterparty. We record changes in the fair value of our derivative financial instruments in our consolidated statements of operations as follows:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><ul id="l70"><li style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">Commodity-based derivatives: “Total revenue”</p></li><li style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">Corporate interest rate derivatives: “Interest expense”</p></li></ul></li></ol><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Our formal hedging program provides a control structure and governance for our hedging activities specific to identified risks and time periods, which are subject to the approval and monitoring by the board of directors of our general partner. We employ derivative financial instruments in connection with an underlying asset, liability or anticipated transaction, and we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The price assumptions we use to value our derivative financial instruments can affect net income for each period. We use published market price information where available, or quotations from over-the-counter, or OTC, market makers to find executable bids and offers. The valuations also reflect the potential impact of conditions, including credit risk of our counterparties. The amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements change quarterly as these valuations are revised to reflect actual results, changes in market conditions or other factors, many of which are beyond our control.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Our earnings are affected by use of mark-to-market method of accounting as required under GAAP for derivative financial instruments. The use of mark-to-market accounting for derivative financial instruments can cause noncash earnings volatility resulting from changes in the underlying indices, primarily commodity prices.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Comprehensive income (loss)</h4><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The Partnership’s other comprehensive income (loss) is comprised of adjustments to other post-retirement plan assets and liabilities. See Note 16, &quot;Post-Employment Benefits&quot;.</p><h4 style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Unit-based employee compensation</h4><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">We award unit-based compensation to management, non-management employees and directors in the form of phantom units, which are deemed to be equity awards. Compensation expense on phantom units is measured by the fair value of the award at the</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">F-14</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="776" height="2" alt="image" src="NYSE_AMID_2012/Image_217.png"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">date of grant as determined by management. Compensation expense is recognized in equity compensation expense over the requisite service period of each award. See Note 15, &quot;Long-Term Incentive Plan&quot;.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Fair value measurements</h4><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">We apply the authoritative accounting provisions for measuring fair value of our derivative instruments and disclosures associated with our outstanding indebtedness. We define fair value as an exit price representing the expected amount we would receive when selling an asset or pay to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction with market participants at the measurement date.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">We use various assumptions and methods in estimating the fair values of our financial instruments. The carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable and accounts payable approximated their fair value due to the short-term maturity of these instruments. The carrying amount of our various credit facilities approximate fair value, because the interest rates on these facilities are variable.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">We employ a hierarchy which prioritizes the inputs we use to measure recurring fair value into three distinct categories based upon whether such inputs are observable in active markets or unobservable. We classify assets and liabilities in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Our methodology for categorizing assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value pursuant to this hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets and the lowest level to unobservable inputs as outlined below:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><ul id="l71"><li style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: -17pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">Level 1 – Inputs represent unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;</p></li><li style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">Level 2 – Inputs include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable; and</p></li><li style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">Level 3 – Inputs are unobservable and considered significant to fair value measurement.</p></li></ul><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">We utilize a mid-market pricing convention, or the “market approach”, for valuation for assigning fair value to our derivative assets and liabilities. Our credit exposure for over-the-counter derivatives is directly with our counterparty and continues until the maturity or termination of the contracts. As appropriate, valuations are adjusted for various factors such as credit and liquidity considerations.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Debt issuance costs</h4><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Costs incurred in connection with the issuance of long-term debt are deferred and charged to interest expense over the term of the related debt. Gains or losses on debt repurchase and debt extinguishment include any associated unamortized debt issue costs.</p><h4 style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Noncontrolling interest</h4><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Noncontrolling interest represents the noncontrolling interest holders&#39; proportionate share of the equity of the Chatom system. Noncontrolling interest is adjusted for the noncontrolling interest holders&#39; proportionate share of the earnings or losses. Management reports noncontrolling interest in the Chatom system in the financial statements pursuant to paragraph ASC No. 810-10-65-1. The 12.6% noncontrolling interest is held by non-affiliated working interest owners.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Limited partners’ net income (loss) per unit</h4><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">We compute limited partners’ net income (loss) per unit by dividing our limited partners’ interest in net income (loss) by the weighted average number of units outstanding during the period. The overall computation, presentation and disclosure of our limited partners’ net income (loss) per unit are made in accordance with the FASB Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 260 “Earnings per Share”.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><ol id="l72"><li style="padding-left: 16pt;text-indent: -9pt;text-align: justify;"><p class="s6" style="display: inline;">Acquisitions</p><h4 style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Chatom Gathering, Processing and Fractionation Plant</h4><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Effective July 1, 2012 , we acquired an 87.4% undivided interest in the Chatom system from affiliates of Quantum Resources Management, LLC. The acquisition fair value consideration of $51.4 million includes a credit associated with the cash flow the Chatom system generated between January 1, 2012 , and the effective date of July 1, 2012 .

No liabilities of the Seller were assumed. The purchase was effective November 1, 2011 (“Effective Date”) with our assumption of insurable risks, operating liabilities and entitlement to in-kind revenues as of that date. The remaining 50% undivided interest is owned by the Plant operator, Enterprise Gas Processing,</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">F-16</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 2pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="776" height="2" alt="image" src="NYSE_AMID_2012/Image_220.png"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">LLC (“Operator”). The Plant, which is an unincorporated venture, is governed by a construction and operating agreement (“Agreement”).</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The Plant is located in St. Mary Parish, Louisiana, and processes raw natural gas using a cryogenic expander. The Plant inlet volumes are sourced from offshore natural gas production via our Quivira system, Gulf South pipelines and onshore from individual producers near the plant. The Partnership’s Quivira system currently supplies approximately 85% of the inlet volume to the Plant. The residue gas is transported, via pipeline to Gulf South and Tennessee Gas Pipeline and the Y-grade liquid is transported via pipeline to K/D/S Promix, LLC (“Promix”), an Enterprise-operated fractionator. The current capacity of the Plant is 165 MMcf/d. The acquisition complemented our existing assets given the location of the Plant in comparison to the Quivira system and is included in our gathering and processing segment.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The Plant is not a legal entity but rather an asset that is jointly owned by the Operator and us. We acquired an interest in the asset group and do not hold an interest in a legal entity. Each of the owners in the asset group is proportionately liable for the liabilities. Outside of the rights and responsibilities of the Operator, we and the Operator have equal rights and obligations to the assets. Significant non-capital and maintenance capital expenditures, plant expansions and significant plant dispositions require the approval of both owners.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Under the terms of the Agreement, the Operator is required to provide monthly production allocation and expense statements to us and is not required to prepare and provide to us balance sheet information or stand-alone financial statements. Historically, balance sheet and stand-alone financial statements for the Plant have not been prepared and are, therefore, not available.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">We reviewed the governance structure of the Plant and applied the concepts discussed in ASC-810-10-45, <i>Other Presentation Matters </i>. We determined that while the facility is an unincorporated joint venture, the asset group is jointly controlled with the Operator.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">We reviewed the requirements for the application of the equity method of accounting, given the joint control attribute of the Plant, and because complete Plant financial statements are not, nor expected to be, available from the Operator, we have elected to account for our Interest using the proportionate consolidation method. Our interest in the Plant is recorded in property, plant and equipment, net on the consolidated balance sheet and will be depreciated over 40 years . Under this method, we include in our consolidated statement of operations the value of our Plant revenues taken in-kind and the Plant expenses reimbursed to the Operator.</p><p style="padding-top:

justify;">Commodity derivatives</h4><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">To minimize the effect of commodity prices and maintain our cash flow and the economics of our development plans, we enter into commodity hedge contracts from time to time. The terms of the contracts depend on various factors, including management’s view of future commodity prices, acquisition economics on purchased assets and future financial commitments. This hedging program is designed to mitigate the effect of commodity price downturns while allowing us to participate in some commodity price upside. Management regularly monitors the commodity markets and financial commitments to determine if, when, and at what level commodity hedging is appropriate in accordance with policies that are established by the board of directors of our general partner. Currently, the commodity derivatives are in the form of swaps, puts and collars. As of December 31, 2012 , the aggregate notional volume of our commodity derivatives was 15.1 million gallons.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">We enter into commodity contracts with multiple counterparties. We may be required to post collateral with our counterparties in connection with our derivative positions. As of December 31, 2012 , we have not posted collateral with our counterparties. The counterparties are not required to post collateral with us in connection with their derivative positions. Netting agreements are in place with our counterparties that permit us to offset our commodity derivative asset and liability positions.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">In June 2011, the Board of Directors of our general partner determined that we would gain operational and strategic flexibility from canceling our then-existing NGL swap contracts and entering into new NGL swap contracts with an existing counterparty that extended through the end of 2012 . During 2012, we entered into additional commodity contracts with existing counterparties to hedge our 2012 and 2013 exposure to commodity prices.</p><h4 style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Interest rate derivatives</h4><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The Partnership may utilize interest rate caps to protect against changes in interest rates on its floating rate debt. In order to mitigate the risk of changes in cash flows attributable to changes in market interest rates, the Partnership entered into interest rate caps that mitigate the risk of increases in interest rates. For the year ended December 31, 2011, we had interest rate caps with a notional amount of up to $25.0 million that effectively fix the base rate on that portion of our debt, with a fixed maximum rate of 4% , which expired during the fourth quarter of 2011. As of December 31, 2012 and 2011, we held no interest rate derivatives.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">For accounting purposes, no derivative instruments were designated as hedging instruments and were instead accounted for under the mark-to- market method of accounting, with any changes in the fair value of the derivatives recorded in the consolidated balance sheets and through earnings, rather than being deferred until the anticipated transactions affect earnings. The use of mark-to-market accounting for financial instruments can cause non-cash earnings volatility due to changes in the underlying commodity price indices or interest rates.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">As of December 31, 2012 and 2011 , the fair value associated with our commodity derivative instruments were recorded in

establishes a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value. These tiers include:</p><ul id="l73"><li style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: -17pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">Level 1 – Inputs represent unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;</p></li><li style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">Level 2 – Inputs include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable; and</p></li><li style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">Level 3 – Inputs are unobservable and considered significant to fair value measurement.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">A financial instrument’s categorization within the fair value hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Our assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement requires judgment and may affect the classification of assets and liabilities within the fair value hierarchy.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">We believe the carrying amount of cash and cash equivalents approximates fair value because of the short-term maturity of these instruments would be classified as Level 1 under the fair value hierarchy.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The recorded value of the amounts outstanding under the credit facility approximates its fair value, as interest rates are variable, based on prevailing market rates and the short-term nature of borrowings and repayments under the credit facility. Our existing revolving credit facility would be classified as Level 1 under the fair value hierarchy.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The fair value of all derivatives instruments is estimated using a market valuation methodology based upon forward commodity price curves, volatility curves as well as other relevant economic measures, if necessary.

We will recognize transfers between levels at the end of the reporting period for which the transfer has occurred. We recognized transfers out of Level 3 into Level 2 as a result of changes in tenure and market points of certain contracts in the amount of $1.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2012.

When a determination is made to classify a financial instrument within Level 3 of the valuation hierarchy, the determination is based upon the significance of the unobservable factors to the overall fair value measurement. Level 3 financial instruments typically include, in addition to the unobservable or Level 3 components, observable components (that is, components that are actively quoted and can be validated to external sources). Contracts classified as Level 3 are valued using internally developed price inputs and curves constructed as a result of the long dated nature of the transactions or the illiquidity of the market points. Contracts classified as Level 2 are valued using inputs and curves that are supported and available from public markets to the extent that the markets or the relevant settlement periods are

6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">We pay premiums to our insurance carrier which provides us with property damage, business interruption and other insurance coverage, the scope and amounts of which we believe are customary and prudent for the nature and extent of our operations. While we believe we maintain adequate insurance coverage on our behalf, insurance may not fully cover every type of damage, interruption or other loss that might occur. If we were to incur a significant loss for which we were not fully insured, it could have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, there may be timing differences between amounts we accrue related to property damage expense, amounts we are required to pay in connection with a loss and amounts we subsequently receive from insurance carriers as reimbursements. Any event that materially interrupts the revenues generated by our consolidated operations, or other losses that require us to make material expenditures not reimbursed by insurance, could reduce our ability to pay distributions to our unitholders and, accordingly, adversely affect the market price of our common units.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Involuntary conversions result from the loss of an asset because of some unforeseen event (e.g., destruction due to hurricanes). Some of these events are insurable, thus resulting in a property damage insurance recovery. Amounts we receive from insurance carriers are net of any deductibles related to the covered event. During the year ended December 31, 2012 , we collected $0.5 million of nonrefundable cash proceeds from our insurance carrier that we recognized as an offset to property, plant and equipment write-downs of $1.5 million due to property damage under the caption <i>Gain (loss) on involuntary conversion of property, plant and equipment. </i>These proceeds relate to property damage claims we made in connection with the named windstorm Hurricane Isaac in September of 2012 . To the extent that additional non-refundable insurance proceeds related to this incident are received, we expect to record gains equal to such proceeds.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p></li><li style="padding-left: 16pt;text-indent: -9pt;text-align: left;"><p class="s6" style="display: inline;">Asset Retirement Obligation</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">We record a liability for the fair value of asset retirement obligations and conditional asset retirement obligations that we can reasonably estimate, on a discounted basis, in the period in which the liability is incurred. We collectively refer to asset retirement obligations and conditional asset retirement obligations as ARO. Typically, we record an ARO at the time the assets are installed or acquired if a reasonable estimate of fair value can then be made. In connection with establishing an ARO, we capitalize the costs as part of the carrying value of the related assets. We recognize an ongoing expense for the interest component of the liability as part of depreciation expense resulting from changes in the value of the ARO due to the passage of time. We depreciate the initial capitalized costs over the useful lives of the related assets. We extinguish the liabilities for an ARO when assets are taken out of service or otherwise abandoned.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">During the

9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">On August 1, 2011, we executed a $100 million revolving credit facility, with a $50 million accordion feature which, if exercised, would increase the total commitment under the facility to $150 million.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">On June 27, 2012, we amended our credit facility to increase the commitments from an aggregate principal amount of $100 million to an aggregate principal amount of $200 million , evidenced by a credit agreement with Bank of America, N.A., as Administrative Agent, Collateral Agent and L/C Issuer; Comerica Bank and Citicorp North America, Inc., as Co-Syndication Agents; BBVA Compass, as Documentation Agent; and the other financial institutions party thereto. The credit facility also provides for a $50 million dollar accordion feature. If the accordion feature were to be fully exercised, the total commitment under the existing facility would be $250 million .</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The amended credit facility provides for a maximum borrowing equal to the lesser of (i) $200 million or (ii) 4.50 times adjusted consolidated EBITDA. Prior to the Third Amendment described below, we could elect to have loans under the new credit facility bear interest either at a Eurodollar-based rate plus a margin ranging from 2.25% to 3.50% depending on our total leverage ratio then in effect, or a base rate which is a fluctuating rate per annum equal to the highest of (a) the Federal Funds Rate plus 1/2 of 1%, (b) the rate of interest in effect for such day as publicly announced from time to time by Bank of America as its “prime rate”, or (c) the Eurodollar Rate plus 1.00% plus a margin ranging from 1.25% to 2.50% depending on the total leverage ratio then in effect. We also paid a commitment fee of 0.50% per annum on the undrawn portion of the revolving loan. For the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010 , the weighted average interest rate on borrowings under our credit facilities was approximately 4.09% , 6.71% , and 7.48% , respectively.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Our obligations under the credit facility are secured by a first mortgage in favor of the lenders in our real property. Advances made under the credit facility are guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by our subsidiaries (“Guarantors”). These guarantees are full and unconditional and joint and several among the Guarantors. The terms of the new credit facility include covenants that restrict</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">F-24</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 2pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="776" height="2" alt="image" src="NYSE_AMID_2012/Image_287.png"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">our ability to make cash distributions and acquisitions in some circumstances. The remaining principal balance of loans and any accrued and unpaid interest will be due and payable in full on the maturity date, August 1, 2016 .</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The credit facility also contains customary representations and warranties (including those relating to organization and authorization, compliance with laws, absence of defaults, material agreements and litigation) and customary events of default (including those relating to monetary defaults, covenant defaults, cross defaults and bankruptcy events). The primary financial covenants contained in the credit facility are (i) a total leverage ratio test (not to exceed 4.50 times ) and a minimum interest coverage ratio test (which, prior to the Third Amendment count not less than 2.50 ).</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">As of December 31, 2012, the total leverage ratio test, one of the primary financial covenants that we are required to maintain under our credit facility, was not to exceed 4.50 times . At December 31, 2012, our total indebtedness was approximately $130.9 million , which caused our total leverage to EBITDA ratio to be approximately 5.70 -to-1. As a result, on December 26, 2012, the Partnership entered into the Third Amendment and Waiver to Credit Agreement, dated as of December 26, 2012 (the “Third Amendment”). The Third Amendment provided for a waiver of the Partnership&#39;s compliance with the Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio with respect to the quarter ending December 31, 2012 and for one month thereafter. The Third Amendment also requires the Partnership to provide certain financial and operating information of the Partnership on a monthly basis for 2013 and for any month after 2013 in which the Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio of the Partnership is in excess of 4.00 to</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">1.00. The remaining material terms and conditions of the senior secured revolving credit facility, including pricing, maturity and covenants, remained unchanged by the Third Amendment.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">See Note 22 <i>&quot; </i>Liquidity&quot; for further updates to our liquidity and Long-term debt.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Our outstanding borrowings under the credit facility at December 31, 2012 and 2011 , respectively, were:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s11" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-bottom: 1pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: right;">December 31,</p><p style="padding-left: 419pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="226" height="1" alt="image" src="NYSE_AMID_2012/Image_288.png"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="776" height="19" alt="image" src="NYSE_AMID_2012/Image_289.png"/></span></p><p class="s11" style="padding-top: 2pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: right;">2012 2011</p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: right;">(in thousands)</p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-bottom: 1pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Revolving loan facility $ 128,285 $ 66,270</p><p class="s42" style="padding-left: 419pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 2pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="110" height="3" alt="image" src="NYSE_AMID_2012/Image_290.png"/></span> <span><img width="110" height="3" alt="image" src="NYSE_AMID_2012/Image_291.png"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">At December 31, 2012 and 2011 , respectively, letters of credit outstanding under the credit facility were $2.6 million and $0.6 million , respectively.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">In connection with our credit facility and amendments thereto, we have incurred $4.3 million in cumulative debt issuance costs through December 31, 2012 which are being amortized on a straight-line basis over the term of the credit facility.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p></li><li style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: left;"><p class="s6" style="display: inline;">Partners’ Capital</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Our capital accounts are comprised of a 2.0% general partner interest and 98.0% limited partner interests.

As a result of these transactions, which were also consummated on April 15, 2013, High Point acquired both control of our general partner and a majority of our outstanding limited partnership interests. See Note 23 &quot; Subsequent Events&quot; for further information.</p><h4 style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">General Partner Interest and Incentive Distribution Rights</h4><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Our partnership agreement provides that our general partner initially will be entitled to 2.0% of all distributions that we make prior to our liquidation. Our general partner has the right, but not the obligation, to contribute a proportionate amount of capital to us in order to maintain its 2.0% general partner interest if we issue additional units. Our general partner’s 2.0% interest, and the percentage of our cash distributions to which it is entitled from such 2.0% interest, will be proportionately reduced if we issue additional units in the future and our general partner does not contribute a proportionate amount of capital to us in order to maintain its 2.0% general partner interest. Our partnership agreement does not require that our general partner fund its capital contribution with cash. It may instead fund its capital contribution by the contribution to us of common units or other property.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Incentive distribution rights represent the right to receive an increasing percentage ( 13.0% , 23.0% and 48.0% ) of quarterly distributions of available cash from operating surplus after the minimum quarterly distribution and the target distribution levels have been achieved. Our general partner currently holds the incentive distribution rights, but may transfer these rights separately from its general partner interest, subject to restrictions in our partnership agreement.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The following discussion assumes that our general partner maintains its 2.0% general partner interest, that there are no arrearages on common units and that our general partner continues to own the incentive distribution rights.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">If for any quarter:</p><ul id="l76"><li style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">we have distributed available cash from operating surplus to the common and subordinated unitholders in an amount equal to the minimum quarterly distribution; and</p></li><li style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">we have distributed available cash from operating surplus on outstanding common units in an amount necessary to eliminate any cumulative arrearages in payment of the minimum quarterly distribution;</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">then, we will distribute any additional available cash from operating surplus for that quarter among the unitholders and our general partner in the following manner:</p></li><li style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: left;"><p class="s25" style="display: inline;">first <span class="p">, 98.0% to all unitholders, pro rata, and 2.0% to our general partner, until each unitholder receives a total of $0.47438 per unit for that quarter (the “first target distribution”);</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">F-26</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 2pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="776" height="2" alt="image" src="NYSE_AMID_2012/Image_293.png"/></span></p></li><li style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: left;"><p class="s25" style="display: inline;">second <span class="p">, 85.0% to all unitholders, pro rata, and 15.0% to our general partner, until each unitholder receives a total of $0.51563 per unit for that quarter (the “second target distribution”);</span></p></li><li style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: left;"><p class="s25" style="display: inline;">third <span class="p">, 75.0% to all unitholders, pro rata, and 25.0% to our general partner, until each unitholder receives a total of $0.61875 per unit for that quarter (the “third target distribution”); and</span></p></li><li style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: left;"><p class="s25" style="display: inline;">thereafter <span class="p">, 50.0% to all unitholders, pro rata, and 50.0% to our general partner.</span></p></li></ul></li></ol><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Distributions</h4><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">We made distributions of $16.1 million , $9.8 million and $11.8 million for years ended December 31, 2012 , 2011 and 2010 , respectively.

Basic and diluted net income (loss) per limited partner unit is calculated by dividing limited partners’ interest in net income (loss) by the weighted average number of outstanding limited partner units during the period.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Unvested unit-based payment awards that contain non-forfeitable rights to distributions (whether paid or unpaid) are classified as participating securities and are included in our computation of basic and diluted net income per limited partner unit.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">We compute earnings per unit  using the two-class  method. The two-class  method requires  that  securities that  meet  the definition of a participating security be considered for inclusion in the computation of basic earnings per unit. Under the two-class method, earnings per unit is calculated as if all of the earnings for the period were distributed under the terms of the partnership agreement, regardless of whether the general partner has discretion over the amount of distributions to be made in any particular period, whether those earnings would actually be distributed during a particular period from an economic or practical perspective, or whether the general partner has other legal or contractual limitations on its ability to pay distributions that would prevent it from distributing all of the earnings for a particular period.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The two-class method does not impact our overall net income or other financial results; however, in periods in which aggregate net income exceeds our aggregate distributions for such period, it will have the impact of reducing net income per limited partner unit. This result occurs as a larger portion of our aggregate earnings, as if distributed, is allocated to the incentive distribution rights of the general partner, even though we make distributions on the basis of available cash and not earnings. In periods in which our aggregate net income does not exceed our aggregate distributions for such period, the two-class method does not have any impact on our calculation of earnings per limited partner unit. We have no dilutive securities, therefore basic and diluted net income per unit are the same.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">We determined basic

On November 2, 2009 , the board of directors of our general partner adopted an LTIP for its employees, consultants and directors who perform services for it or its affiliates. On May 25, 2010, the board of directors of our general partner adopted an amended and restated LTIP. On July 11, 2012, the board of directors of our general partner adopted a second amended and restated long-term incentive plan that effectively increased available awards by 871,750 units. At December 31, 2012 , 2011 and 2010 , there were 920,193 , 54,827 and 62,246 units, respectively, available for future grant under the LTIP giving retroactive treatment to the reverse unit split described in Note 13 “Partners’ Capital”.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Ownership in the awards is subject to forfeiture until the vesting date. The LTIP is administered by the board of directors of our general partner. The board of directors of our general partner, at its discretion, may elect to settle such vested phantom units with a number of units equivalent to the fair market value at the date of vesting in lieu of cash. Although our general partner has the option to settle in cash upon the vesting of phantom units, our general partner has not historically settled these awards in cash. Although other types of awards are contemplated under the LTIP, the only currently outstanding awards are phantom units without dividend equivalent rights (&quot;DERs&quot;).</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Generally, grants issued under the LTIP vest in increments of 25% on each grant anniversary date and do not contain any vesting requirements other than continued employment.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Prior to our initial public offering, the fair value of the grants issued was calculated by the general partner based on several valuation models, including: a discounted cash flow (&quot;DCF&quot;) model, a comparable company multiple analysis and a comparable recent transaction multiple analysis. As it relates to the DCF model, the model includes certain market assumptions related to future throughput volumes, projected fees and/or prices, expected costs of sales and direct operating costs and risk adjusted discount rates. Both the comparable company analysis and recent transaction analysis contain significant assumptions consistent with the DCF model, in addition to assumptions related to comparability, appropriateness of multiples (primarily based on EBITDA and DCF) and certain assumptions in the calculation of enterprise value.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left:

The overall expected rates of return are based on the asset allocation targets with estimates for returns on equity and debt securities based on long term expectations. We believe this rate approximates the return we will achieve over the long-term on the assets of our plans. Historically, we have used a discount rate that corresponds to one or more high quality corporate bond indices as an estimate of our expected long-term rate of return on plan assets for our OPEB Plan assets. For 2012 , 2011 and 2010 we selected the discount rate using the Citigroup Pension Discount Curve, or CPDC. The CPDC spot rates represent the equivalent yield on high-quality, zero-coupon bonds for specific maturities. These rates are used to develop a single, equivalent discount rate based on the OPEB Plan’s expected future cash flows.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4

In addition, we determined that certain SO <span class="s27">2 </span>emissions during 2009 and 2010 exceeded the reportable quantity threshold <span class="p">under the federal Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act, or EPCRA, requiring notification of various governmental authorities.

After discussion with the MDEQ, in February 2012 we submitted an application to amend our Title V Air Permit to </span>account for these SO <span class="s27">2 </span>emissions. The MDEQ is currently processing this permit application. In December 2011, EPA Region IV performed an <span class="p">inspection of the plant, and they followed up with an Information Request in May 2012.

Segment gross margin for our Transmission segment consists of revenue, less purchases of natural gas and COMA. Gross margin consists of the sum of the segment gross margin amounts for each of these segments. As an indicator of our operating performance, gross margin should not be considered an alternative to, or more meaningful than, net income or cash flow from operations as determined in accordance with GAAP. Our gross margin may not be comparable to a similarly titled measure of another company because other entities may not calculate gross margin in the same manner. Effective October 1, 2012, we changed our segment gross margin measure to exclude construction, operating and maintenance agreement (“COMA”) income. For the year ended December 31, 2012, $0.7 million and $2.7 million in COMA income was excluded from our Gathering and Processing segment gross margin and our Transmission segment gross margin, respectively.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p></li><li style="padding-left: 37pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;"><p style="display: inline;">Effective January 1, 2011, we changed our segment gross margin measure to exclude unrealized non-cash mark-to-market adjustments related to our commodity derivatives.

The subsidiaries of the Partnership (the &quot;Subsidiaries&quot;) are co-registrants with the Partnership, and the registration statement registers guarantees of debt securities by one or more of the Subsidiaries (other than American Midstream Finance Corporation, a 100% owned subsidiary of the Partnership whose sole purpose is to act as co-issuer of such debt securities). The financial position and operations of the co-issuer are minor and therefore have been included with the Parent&#39;s financial information. As of June 30, 2012 , the Subsidiaries were 100% owned by the Partnership and any guarantees by the Subsidiaries will be full and unconditional. As of December 31, 2012 , the Subsidiaries have an investment in the non-guarantor subsidiaries equal to an 87.4% undivided interest in its Chatom system. The Partnership has no assets or operations independent of the Subsidiaries, and there are no significant restrictions upon the ability of the Subsidiaries to distribute funds to the Partnership. In the event that more than one of the Subsidiaries provide guarantees of any debt securities issued by the Partnership, such guarantees will constitute joint and several obligations. None of the assets of the Partnership or the Subsidiaries represent restricted net assets pursuant to Rule 4-08(e)(3) of Regulation S-X under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. For purposes of the following condensed consolidating financial  information, the Partnership&#39;s  investments in its  Subsidiaries and the guarantor subsidiaries&#39; investment in its 87.4% undivided interest in the Chatom system are presented in accordance with the equity method of accounting. The financial information may not necessarily be indicative of the financial position, results of operations, or cash flows had the subsidiary guarantors operated as independent entities. Condensed consolidating financial information for the Partnership, its combined guarantor subsidiaries and non-guarantor subsidiary as of December 31, 2012 and for the year ended is as follows:</p><p

comply with certain financial covenants and ratios in our credit facility. As of December 31, 2012, the total leverage ratio test, one of the primary financial covenants that we are required to maintain under our credit facility, was not to exceed 4.50 times. At December 31, 2012, our total indebtedness was approximately $130.9 million , which caused our total leverage to EBITDA ratio to be approximately 5.70 - to-1. As a result, on December 26, 2012, the Partnership entered into the Third Amendment and Waiver to Credit Agreement, dated as of December 26, 2012 (the “Third Amendment”). The Third Amendment provided for a waiver of the Partnership&#39;s compliance with the Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio with respect to the quarter</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">F-40</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="776" height="2" alt="image" src="NYSE_AMID_2012/Image_354.png"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">ending December 31, 2012 and for one month thereafter. The Third Amendment also requires the Partnership to provide certain financial and operating information of the Partnership on a monthly basis for 2013 and for any month after 2013 in which the Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio of the Partnership is in excess of 4.00 to 1.00. The remaining material terms and conditions of the senior secured revolving credit facility, including pricing, maturity and covenants, remained unchanged by the Third Amendment.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">On January 24, 2013, the Partnership entered into the second waiver to the credit facility that extended the waiver period with respect to the Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio to March 31, 2013 (and subsequently extended to April 16, 2013). Additional covenants during the waiver period included i) total outstanding borrowings under the credit facility shall not exceed $150,000,000 ; ii) restrictions on certain acquisitions;</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">iii) an increase to the Eurodollar rate by 0.50% ; iv) additional fees of 0.125% of the principal amount on each of February 28, 2013 and March 31, 2013; and v) execution of a compliance certificate.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">On April 15, 2013, we repaid approximately $12.5 million in outstanding borrowings under the credit agreement and entered into the Fourth Amendment in connection with the ArcLight Transaction (see Note 23 - <i>Subsequent Events </i>for further information).
