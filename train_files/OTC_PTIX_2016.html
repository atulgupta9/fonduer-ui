In addition, we are exploring non-dilutive funding opportunities.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s3" style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">As reported previously, our most advanced drug candidate, PT00114, continues to show encouraging signals to potentially treat depression and anxiety, as well as other mood and addiction-related diseases. A chronic anxiety efficacy study is one of the two new studies we recently initiated. This study is being conducted for us at a contract research organization (CRO) in Europe. Our objective is to independently validate the activity of PT00114. Our analysis of the outcomes data received so far indicates beneficial effects of TCAP in reducing stress-related behaviors in a set of well-established rodent behavior tests known the “chronic social defeat” model. These studies demonstrated that PT00114 modulates behavioral responses under stress conditions in rodents. We are encouraged by these results.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s3" style="padding-left: 59pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A second study, aimed at demonstrating efficacy of PT00114 in treating pathologic drug addiction, is underway at another CRO, which we selected because it is a leader in the neuroscience space, particularly in behavioral studies of addiction. In a previous study, we saw that PT00114 reduced cocaine seeking activity in stressed rodents. Once replicated, the cocaine studies will be followed by those designed to demonstrate that PT00114 may have the potential to ameliorate drug seeking activity in an opiate model of addiction.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s3" style="padding-left: 59pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">We anticipate that our current efforts will result in an IND submission to the FDA in the first half of 2018 if both efficacy and toxicology studies have a positive outcome. Upon a successful IND submission and acceptance by the FDA, we anticipate being able to commence Phase I clinical trials in 2018.</p><p class="s3" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 59pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In summary, last year we completed a reverse merger and a private financing, and since then have been executing our plan to move us closer to our expected filing of an IND application with the FDA. Our R&amp;D team is carrying out the steps to accomplish these tasks, including outsourcing our most recent preclinical efficacy studies. In parallel, we continue to add to our intellectual property estate and will strategically add to our IP portfolio over time. We are motivated by our progress to date and for the potential of our novel lead compound to change the way mood disorders are treated.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 60pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="152" height="90" alt="image" src="OTC_PTIX_2016/Image_024.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s3" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 59pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Garo H.

We believe that we can establish and subsequently strengthen our market position in the following ways: (i) working to obtain FDA approval of current and future neuropeptide applications; (ii) investigating foreign markets for the use of our current and future products; (iii) securing relationships with strong partners in our field; (iv) entering into license agreements, strategic partnerships and joint ventures for our various applications; and, (v) continuing our current research into improving our processes, reducing costs and developing new and innovative applications.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: justify;">We intend to advance our lead drug candidate, PT00114 through Investigational New Drug (IND)-enabling studies, and enter PT00114 into clinical proof-of-concept studies in Treatment-Resistant Depression (TRD) and/or Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) (anticipated clinical start: 2017-2018).</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s13" style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Corporate History</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: justify;">We are currently a Delaware corporation with one subsidiary named Protagenic Therapeutics Canada (2006) Inc., a corporation formed in 2006 under the laws of the Province of Ontario, Canada.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: justify;">We were most recently known as Atrinsic, Inc., a company that was once a reporting company under the Securities Act, but that, in 2012 and 2013, reorganized under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code and emerged from bankruptcy. On February 12, 2016, we acquired Protagenic Therapeutics, Inc. through a reverse merger (see “<span class="h4">Corporate History – The Reverse Business Combination (Merger) Transaction</span>”). On June 17, 2016, Protagenic Therapeutics, Inc. (the then wholly-owned subsidiary of Atrinsic, Inc.) was merged with and into Atrinsic, Inc. Atrinsic, Inc. was the surviving corporation in this merger and changed its name from Atrinsic, Inc. to Protagenic Therapeutics, Inc.

In 2007, Millbrook Acquisition Corp. changed its name to New Motion, Inc. In 2008, New Motion, Inc. merged with Traffix, Inc., pursuant to which Traffix, Inc. became wholly-owned subsidiary of New Motion, Inc. In 2009, New Motion, Inc. changed its name to Atrinsic, Inc. On June 15, 2012, we filed Chapter 11 in the United States Bankruptcy Court in Southern District of New York (Case No. 12-12553). As of that date, we terminated all remaining employees and ceased normal business operations.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: justify;">Prior to March 30, 2012, the Company was a reporting company under the Exchange Act, and filed periodic reports with the SEC. On March 30, 2012, we filed a Form 15 with the SEC, terminating our obligation to file periodic reports under Sections 13 and 15(d) of the Exchange Act. Prior to the filing of our Plan of Reorganization under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code on June 15, 2012 (the “Plan of Reorganization”), we were a marketer of direct-to-consumer subscription products and an Internet search marketing agency. We sold entertainment and lifestyle subscription products directly to consumers, which we marketed through the Internet. We also sold Internet marketing services to our corporate and advertising clients.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: justify;">We emerged from Chapter 11 on June 26, 2013, at which time the Plan of Reorganization was conditionally confirmed by the United States Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York. The confirmation was subject to the consummation of the Company’s acquisition of a 51% controlling interest in MomSpot LLC (“MomSpot”), which was subsequently completed on July 12, 2013 (“Emergence Date”). MomSpot’s goal is to be the premier specialty retail affiliate marketing company targeting women between the ages of 24 and 45 who are either mothers or expecting their first child. The Emergence Date was the date the Company adopted fresh start accounting in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 852. The adoption of fresh-start accounting resulted in the Company becoming a new entity for financial reporting purposes. At that time, our principal activities were conducted through MomSpot.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: justify;">On February 12, 2016, we acquired Protagenic Therapeutics, Inc. through a reverse merger, pursuant to which all the issued and outstanding shares of Protagenic common stock converted on a 1-for-1 basis into shares of the Company’s Series B Preferred Stock, par value $0.000001 per share. Concurrently with the reverse merger, we conducted the first closing of a private offering of our Series B Preferred Stock.

On February 12, 2016, the Company sold its 51% interest of MomSpot to the remaining 49% interest holder through a split off agreement. Additionally, on February 12, 2016, the Company sold its equity interests in 29 wholly- owned subsidiaries (see “<span class="h4">Corporate History – Split-Off Agreements</span>”).</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 80pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Reverse Business Combination (Merger) Transaction</h4><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: justify;">On February 12, 2016, which we refer to as the Merger Closing Date, we (as Atrinsic, Inc.), Protagenic Therapeutics, Inc. and Protagenic Acquisition Corp., Atrinsic, Inc.’s wholly-owned subsidiary, entered into a merger agreement and completed the merger contemplated by the merger agreement. Pursuant to the merger agreement, on the Merger Closing Date, Protagenic Acquisition Corp. merged with and into Protagenic Therapeutics, Inc., with Protagenic Therapeutics, Inc. remaining as the surviving entity and wholly-owned subsidiary of Atrinsic, Inc.

Also on the Merger Closing Date, all of the issued and outstanding options to purchase shares of Protagenic common stock, and all of the issued and outstanding warrants to purchase shares of Protagenic common stock, converted, on a 1-for-1 basis, into options (the “New Options”) and new warrants (the “New Warrants”) respectively, to purchase shares of our Series B Preferred Stock. The New Options will be administered under Protagenic’s 2006 Employee, Director and Consultant Stock Plan (the “2006 Plan”), which the Company assumed and adopted on the Merger Closing Date in connection with the Merger.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: justify;">On the Closing Date, (i) the former Protagenic common stock was exchanged for the right to receive 6,612,838 shares of Series B Preferred Stock; (ii) New Options to purchase 1,807,744 shares of Series B Preferred Stock granted under the 2006 Plan, having an average exercise price of approximately $0.87 per share, were issued to optionees pursuant to the assumption of the 2006 Plan; (iii) the holders of options to purchase the common stock of Atrinsic before the Merger (“Predecessor”) were issued options (“Predecessor Options”) to purchase 17,784 shares of Series B Preferred Stock at $1.25 per share; (iv) New Warrants to purchase 3,403,367 shares of Series B Preferred Stock at an average exercise price of approximately $1.05 per share were issued to holders of Protagenic warrants; and (v) 2,775,000 shares of Series B Preferred Stock were issued to investors at a purchase price of $1.25 per share in the Private Offering, as defined below. In addition, warrants (“Predecessor Warrants”) to purchase 295,945 shares of Series B Preferred Stock at $1.25 per share were issued to Strategic Bio Partners, LLC, the designee (the “Designee”) of the holders of Predecessor’s debt, in consideration of the cancellation of debt of $665,000 in principal and $35,000 in interest, and Placement Agent Warrants, as such term is defined below, to purchase 127,346 shares of Series B Preferred Stock were issued to the Placement Agent of the Private Offering.

In addition, upon the effectiveness of the Merger, the holders of the Predecessor’s Series A Preferred Stock exchanged all of the issued and outstanding Series A Preferred Stock for an aggregate of 297,468 shares of Series B Preferred Stock. These shares were issued to the Designee.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: justify;">The Merger was treated as a recapitalization of Protagenic for financial accounting purposes and the historical financial statements of Protagenic Therapeutics, Inc. are our financial statements as a result of the Merger.

At the first closing, we sold 2,775,000 shares of Series B Preferred Stock at a purchase price of $1.25 per share, for which we received total gross consideration of $3,468,750. Of this amount, $350,000 consisted of conversion of outstanding stockholder debt held by Garo H. Armen, our chairman and a member of our board of directors, and $150,000 of legal expenses incurred by Strategic Bio Partners LLC, stockholders of the Predecessor, in conjunction with and as allowed by the merger agreement. On March 2, 2016, we completed the second closing of the Private Offering, at which we issued an additional 913,200 shares of Series B Preferred Stock to accredited investors, for total gross proceeds of</p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">$1,141,500.

In addition, the Placement Agent received $15,000 to reimburse it for its expenses in the private Offering, and the placement Agent and its selected dealers were issued warrants (the “Placement Agent Warrants”) to purchase a number of shares of Series B Preferred Stock equal to 10% of the shares of Series B Preferred Stock sold to investors in the Private Offering who were introduced by the Placement Agent and its selected dealers. The Placement Agent Warrants, which contain a “cashless exercise” provision, are exercisable for a period of five years from the initial closing of the Private Offering at a price of $1.25 per share.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: justify;">Pursuant to a registration statement declared effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) on February 8, 2017, we registered the shares of common stock underlying the Series B Preferred Stock and the Placement Agent Warrants issued in the 2016 Private Placement for public resale by the selling stockholders named therein and their assigns.

Global LLC. Barry Eisenberg is the sole owner of B.E. Global LLC and is the Chief Executive Officer of MomSpot LLC. Immediately after the closing of the Merger, we split off our 51% membership interests in MomSpot LLC. The split-off was accomplished through the transfer of all of our membership interests of MomSpot LLC to B.E. Global LLC.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: justify;">Immediately after the closing of the Merger, we split off all of our equity interest in 29 wholly-owned subsidiaries.

As a result of the Reverse Split, 400,000,000 shares of common stock were split into 25,867 shares of common stock. Additionally, as a result of the Reverse Split and in accordance with our certificate of designations for our Series B Preferred Stock, our Series B Preferred Stock immediately and automatically converted into our common stock on a 1-for-1 basis other than any Series B Preferred Stock (i) to the extent (but only to the extent) a Series B Preferred Stock holder would beneficially own greater than 9.99% of our common stock (the “Springing Blocker”) and (ii) such holder has notified the Company in writing that it wants the Springing Blocker to apply to such holder. On July 27, 2016, 10,146,000 of the Company’s 11,018,766 outstanding shares of Series B Preferred Stock were eligible to immediately convert into 10,146,000 shares of the Company’s common stock (accounting for the Reverse Split ratio) with 872,766 shares of Series B Preferred Stock remaining as a result of one holder exercising the Springing Blocker. As of December 31, 2016, 10,146,000 shares of the Series B Preferred Stock were converted into 10,146,000 shares of common stock on the records of the Company.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: justify;">Any Series B Preferred Stock not converted as a result of this provision would automatically convert into common stock as soon as such conversion would not violate the Springing Blocker.

We are the parent company of Protagenic Therapeutics Canada (2006), Inc., a corporation incorporated in the Province of Ontario.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s13" style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Mood and Anxiety Disorders</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: justify;">An estimated 340 million people worldwide and 40-60 million people in the United States alone suffer from mental disorders including Major Depressive Disorder, or MDD, including TRD, PTSD, Bipolar Disorder and various Anxiety Disorders. The global sales of anxiolytic and antidepressant drugs in the US were estimated to be $69 billion in 2013 and are projected to grow to nearly $77.1 billion by 2018. Yet, up to one-half of mood disorder patients are unresponsive to current treatments. Efficacy of therapy is challenged by non-compliance during the weeks to months required to achieve therapeutic benefit in combination with daily dosing requirements. Major targets in this space include TRD and PTSD, both indications which are highly resistant to available therapies.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: justify;">Approximately 37% of those suffering from a MDD that do not respond to the current antidepressant medications constitute a separate group of people suffering from TRD. Despite a large patient population and current treatments that leave much room for improvement, the developmental pipelines are sparse and few novel candidates are in development. The serendipitous discoveries of current drug classes, and lack of efficacy have led to shrinkage or extinction of many pharma or small biotech neuroscience research programs. It is in this TRD market that we intend to focus our PT00114 development efforts.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: justify;">TRD is the type of MDD that does not respond to standard courses of antidepressant medication. Stress plays a significant role in this illness that affects as many as half of people diagnosed with depression. Patients suffering with TRD are at greater risk of hospitalization for their psychiatric illness and are more likely to abuse drugs and alcohol. These patients have a lower long-term quality of life and are at increased risk of attempting suicide. As a last resort, this disease is currently managed by invasive treatment, primarily electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). However, the ECT treatment’s side effects and high cost prevent millions of people from taking advantage of it.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: justify;">According to an article titled “Global prevalence of anxiety disorders: a systemic review and meta-regression,” written by AJ Baxter et al., (published in <i>Psychological Medicine </i>in 2013), PTSD affects an estimated 7.7 million adults (3.5%) in the US, with a disproportionately high prevalence in war veterans. Therapeutic approaches include cognitive therapy in combination with antidepressants, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). In addition to the vulnerabilities noted above for antidepressant-related treatments, PTSD patients often present with co-morbidities such as addictions or dependencies, which make therapeutic case management difficult.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s13" style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Protagenic Research</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: justify;">PT00114 is the first known example of a new class of brain-targeted therapies based on a newly-described and highly conserved family of neuropeptides that regulate stress-induced mood and addictive behaviors. PT00114 is believed to act via a novel mechanism of action and is therefore expected to provide an extremely attractive therapeutic and commercial profile, especially for those patients who are not fully responsive to or compliant with current interventions. Based on preclinical data, we believe that PT00114 is well differentiated from other drug candidates on the basis of having: Dual activity on stress- and addiction-related pathways (as present in TRD and PTSD); Blood-brain barrier permeability; Rapid onset of action and long duration of therapeutic effects; Restoration of normalcy in stress, anxiety and addiction disorders; No adverse effects with little to no accumulation; Good safety and tolerability profiles; Convenient dosing route and schedule; High potency/low dose; and, Ease of chemical synthesis.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: justify;">We believe that optimal cellular energy metabolism is fundamental to the biology of the brain, and clinical manifestation of aberrant energy metabolism often manifests in debilitating neurological disorders. PT00114’s ability in preclinical models to enhance glucose mobilization and utilization in the brain, maintain energy homeostasis, inhibit stress- related pathways and protect cells from oxidative damage suggests potential therapeutic benefits in a range of indications involving both acute and chronic neurological injury. Potential applications include traumatic brain injury, stroke recovery, and neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease and ALS, among others.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s13" style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Technology</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 80pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">PT00114 is a synthetic form of the natural peptide sequence TCAP-1.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: justify;">TCAP-1 was discovered in a genome-wide search for proteins related to corticotropin releasing factor (CRF), a key brain peptide hormone in stress response. While TCAP-1 counteracts stress, it does so by a non-CRF receptor pathway and unlike direct CRF antagonists it does not exhibit negative effects in animal models studied to date.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: justify;">PT00114 inhibits stress and stress (CRF)-induced actions in clinically-relevant gold-standard animal models of anxiety, depression and addiction at concentrations several magnitudes below current front-line therapeutics. These beneficial effects are maintained for as long as three weeks after treatment. PT00114 promotes neuronal process development, spine density, axon fasciculation and branching in neurons.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: justify;">PT00114 crosses the blood brain barrier and concentrates in regions of the brain associated with the regulation of mood disorders. Preliminary toxicity assessment (non-GLP) indicates no clear or significant adverse effects, although further toxicity testing is required.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: justify;">PT00114 is highly soluble and shows excellent stability in several storage conditions. The initial dosage form is intended as a subcutaneous injection but is also amenable to other routes of administration.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s13" style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Business plan / Proposed next steps</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Company’s business plan calls for the following processes during 2017 and 2018:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s13" style="padding-left: 80pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Preclinical Efficacy Data</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: justify;">Historically, much of the preclinical efficacy data regarding specific therapeutic benefits of PT00114 had been generated in the lab of our Chief Technology Officer, Dr. David Lovejoy at the University of Toronto. The Company recognizes that to fully validate its business proposal, and persuade potential corporate partners of target-disease efficacy, additional preclinical efficacy data from unaffiliated research organizations would be valuable. Hence, the Company has engaged two contract research organizations (CROs) to conduct preclinical tests of PT00114 for anxiety and depression, as well as alleviation of drug addictive behavior.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s13" style="padding-left: 80pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Process Development and Manufacturing</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: justify;">In parallel with the Company’s external CRO research studies, the Company is pursuing good manufacturing practices (cGMP) synthesis of PT00114. The Company anticipates that it may obtain enough TCAP in July 2017 to supply its Phase I human clinical trials anticipated to begin in 2018. The Company intendes to secure at least two supplier relationships for sourcing synthesized human PT00114.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s13" style="padding-left: 80pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Preclinical Safety &amp; Toxicology</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: justify;">A key part of the Company’s preclinical studies for IND readiness is the toxicology testing of PT00114 in two animal species. Because these toxicology tests will be carried out with a drug concentration that is a multiple of the intended concentration in the eventual marketable drug, the Company plans to commence its safety and toxicology testing only after receiving a confirmatory positive result from the latest external CRO efficacy tests. This means toxicology testing could begin as soon as the third quarter of 2017.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s13" style="padding-left: 80pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Pursue Strategic Partnership</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: justify;">The Company believes it would be to its advantage to secure a collaboration with a pharma/biopharma company with a presence in neurological and psychiatric diseases and/or addiction. Therefore, it plans to use the preclinical efficacy data to be generated during 2017 as a point of instigation with potential pharma/biopharma corporate partners.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s13" style="padding-left: 80pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Compile and File IND</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The most important corporate goal for which the Company is deploying the working capital it raised in 2016 is the compilation and submission of an investigational new drug (IND) application to the FDA. This is a prerequisite to begin Phase I human testing of PT00114 for any indication. The preclinical efficacy data currently being generated at two external CROs, as well as the toxicology test results that the company plans to obtain, and a specific plan and protocol for a Phase I trial, will be among the components of this key regulatory submission anticipated in early 2018.</p><p class="s13" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 80pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Initiate Phase 1 Clinical Studies</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: justify;">One the Company’s IND application has been filed, the next major milestone is anticipated to be an approval by the Company’s FDA review team that the Phase I trial protocol proposed in the IND application is acceptable to begin. The Company believes that this may be achieved in the second half of 2018.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s13" style="padding-left: 83pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Technology License Agreement</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: justify;">On July 31, 2005, the Company had entered into a Technology License Agreement (“License Agreement”) with the University of Toronto (the “University” or “UT”) pursuant to which the University agreed to license to the Company patent rights and other intellectual property, among other things (the “Technologies”). The Technology License Agreement was amended on February 18, 2015 and currently does not provide for an expiration date.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: justify;">Pursuant to the License Agreement and its amendment, the Company obtained an exclusive worldwide license to make, have made, use, sell and import products based upon the Technologies, or to sublicense the Technologies in accordance with the terms of the License Agreement and amendment. In consideration, the Company agreed to pay to the University a royalty payment of 2.5% of net sales of any product based on the Technologies. If the Company elects to sublicense any rights under the License Agreement and amendment, the Company agrees to pay to the University 10% of any up-front sub- license fees for any sub-licenses that occurred on or after September 9, 2006, and, on behalf of the sub-licensee, 2.5% of net sales by the sub-licensee of all products based on the Technologies. The Company had no sales revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016 and therefore was not subject to paying any royalties.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: justify;">In the event the Company fails to provide the University with semi-annual reports on the progress or fails to continue to make reasonable commercial efforts towards obtaining regulatory approval for products based on the Technologies, the University may convert our exclusive license into a non-exclusive arrangement. Interest on any amounts owed under the License Agreement and amendment will be at 3% per annum. All intellectual property rights resulting from the Technologies or improvements thereon will remain the property of the other inventors and/or Dr. David Lovejoy (“The Professor”) at the University, and/or the University, as the case may be. The Company has agreed to pay all out-of- pocket filing, prosecution and maintenance expenses in connection with any patents relating to the Technologies. In the case of infringement upon any patents relating to the Technologies, the Company may elect, at its own expense, to bring a cause of action asserting such infringement. In such a case, after deducting any legal expenses the Company may incur, any settlement proceeds will be subject to the 2.5% royalty payment owed to the University under the License Agreement and amendment.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: justify;">The patent applications were made in the name of the Professor and other inventors, but the Company’s exclusive, worldwide rights to such patent applications are included in the License Agreement and its amendment with the University. The Company maintains exclusive licensing agreements and it currently controls the six intellectual patent properties.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s13" style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Sales and Marketing</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: justify;">We currently have no sales, marketing or distribution capabilities. In order to commercially market PT00114 and any product candidates we develop in the future, we would either need to develop an internal sales team and marketing department or collaborate with third parties who have sales and marketing capabilities.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s13" style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Manufacturing</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: justify;">We currently do not own any manufacturing facilities, nor have we entered into any agreements with contract manufacturer for the production of PT00114. Currently we synthesize all the PT00114 we use in our development activities.</p><p class="s13" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Competition</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: justify;">The pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries are highly competitive and characterized by rapidly evolving technology and intense research and development efforts. We expect to compete with companies, including major international pharmaceutical companies, and other institutions that have substantially greater financial, research and development, marketing and sales capabilities and have substantially greater experience in undertaking preclinical and clinical testing of products, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing and selling biopharmaceutical products. We will face competition based on, among other things, product efficacy and safety, the timing and scope of regulatory approvals, product ease of use and price.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: justify;">Major depressive disorder patients that do not respond to the current antidepressant medications constitute a separate group of TRD. Despite a large patient population and current treatments that leave much room for improvement, the developmental pipelines are sparse and few novel candidates are in development. The serendipitous discoveries of current drug classes, side effects and lack of efficacy have led to shrinkage or extinction of many pharma or small biotech neuroscience research programs. According to a May 10, 2016 Zion Research report, the current global depression drug market was valued at approximately $14.5 billion in 2014, and is expected to generate $16.8 billion by the end of 2020. Slightly smaller but on the rise, according to Global Industry Analysts, Inc., the global market for anti-anxiety medications is expected to be $5.9 billion in 2017. It is in either or both of the TRD and anti-anxiety markets that we intend to launch PT00114.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: justify;">Set forth below is a discussion of competitive factors for each of the current drug classes commercially available for TRD, and the competitive advantages that we believe PT00114 may offer. The basis for our beliefs regarding the competitive advantages that PT00114 may offer over its competitors is our own pre-clinical animal studies. We acknowledge that these beliefs and conclusions about competitive advantages must be regarded as theoretical until such time as we have human clinical data that supports and re-affirms the results seen in the pre-clinical animal studies.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s15" style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Opioid receptor modulators</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: justify;">Opioid receptor modulators have the potential to be non-addictive therapeutic drugs for TRD. Competitors include ALKS 5461 (from Alkermes) is a fixed combination of buprenorphine and samidorphan being developed as a therapy for TRD. Buprenorphine is a mu opioid receptor partial agonist as well as an antagonist of the kappa-opioid receptor (KOR), while samidorphan is an antagonist of mu opioid receptors that essentially works to block the buprenorphine from binding to the mu-receptor. The combination of these mechanisms may result in attenuation of the mu agonist effects of buprenorphine, potentially making this a non-addictive therapy. ALKS 5461 is in phase 3 as a once-daily therapy administered as a sublingual tablet. It is well tolerated and treatment effects were evident after one week of dosing. We believe that our competitive advantage is that PT00114 targets different receptor system therefore it is not likely to have a clinical overlap with opioid receptor modulators.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s15" style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Antipsychotics with antidepressant effects (dopamine receptor modulators<span class="s13">)</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: justify;">Brexpiprazole (from Otsuka) is a dopamine (D2 receptor) partial stimulator (agonist) approved as an oral adjunctive TRD therapy. Its side effects include suicidal risk, weight gain and restlessness. Cariprazine (from Gedeon Richter) is an oral dopamine D2 and D3 receptor antagonist approved for schizophrenia and bipolar disorder in development for TRD. The most common side effects reported were extrapyramidal symptoms, the urge to move (akathisia), indigestion (dyspepsia), vomiting, drowsiness (somnolence) and restlessness. We believe that our competitive advantage is that PT00114, due to its low toxicity profile, will be clinically preferable to these antipsychotic drugs.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s15" style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Ketamine-like TRD drugs</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: justify;">Drugs that act in a mechanism similar to Ketamine, such as Esketamine nasal spray (from Johnson and Johnson) is the S(+) enantiomer of the drug ketamine acts primarily as a non-competitive NMDA receptor antagonist, but is also a dopamine reuptake inhibitor. As of July 2014, it is in phase II clinical trials for treatment-resistant depression (TRD). This class of candidates is generating a lot of excitement but uncertainty due to their use history will be a compounding factor. We believe that our competitive advantage is that the toxicity profile is likely to be less favorable when compared with PT00114.</p><p class="s15" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">NMDA receptor modulators</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: justify;">The N-methyl-D-aspartate (or “NMDA”) receptor is a molecule that appears on the surface of neurons. When “activated” by a drug that binds with it, the NMDA receptor is a potential natural way to counteract TRD. A drug called GLYX 13, an amidated tetrapeptide (with the amino acid sequence Thr-Pro-Pro-Thr-NH2) is a glycine-site functional partial agonist of the NMDA receptor discovered at Northwestern University, now being developed by Naurex/Allergan, in Phase 3</p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">U.S. clinical trials. It will be administered by intravenous injection and has a rapid onset. Phase 2 results have shown that GLYX 13 treatment reduces depression scores in patients with TRD, with no psychotomimetic side effects common to other NMDA receptor modulators. The major peptide candidate in this group GLYX13 shows a better tolerance profile and even IV dosing once weekly is not a deterrent enough in the clinic so PT00114 peptide with possible subcutaneous delivery would be a much more preferable clinical option. The development of the tetrapeptide and entry into the trials demonstrated room and willingness to accept peptide based therapies in TRD. More candidates are expected to come from this therapeutic class that may present a competitive challenge for PT00114.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: justify;">Another of Naurex’s small molecule candidates, NRX-1074, is an orally active therapy based on GLYX13, in preclinical stages. L-4-Chlorokynurenine, AV-101 (from VistaGen Therapeutics) is a fast acting, orally active small molecule glycine binding site NMDA receptor antagonist. A NIH-funded phase 2 trial in major depressive disorder has been initiated in the US. CERC-301 (Cerecor) is an orally-active, selective NMDA receptor subunit 2B (NR2B) antagonist which is in phase 2 an adjunctive therapy for TRD.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s15" style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">PT00114’s Competitive Advantages/Disadvantages</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 80pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">We believe PT00114 will be able to compete against each of these drugs based on its core advantages:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><ol id="l2"><ul id="l3"><li style="padding-left: 97pt;text-indent: -17pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">PT00114, once in a patient, had a rapid onset of action (efficacy in animal anxiety and depression models) compared with other TRD drugs which may take longer to take effect.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p></li><li style="padding-left: 97pt;text-indent: -17pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">PT00114’s effects are long lasting and potent (single 1-10 nmole/kg dose lasts up to one week for glucose/insulin blood-based biomarkers)</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p></li><li style="padding-left: 97pt;text-indent: -17pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">PT00114 is rapidly cleared from the patient’s bloodstream (its “half life” is 5-10min if given intravenously (IV), 20-30 minutes if given subcutaneously (SC)</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p></li><li style="padding-left: 97pt;text-indent: -17pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">PT00114 naturally crosses the blood brain barrier, while certain other TRD drugs do not naturally do that and therefore must be given at higher doses so that any of them make it into the patient’s brain.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p></li><li style="padding-left: 97pt;text-indent: -17pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">PT00114 is an L-isomer, a naturally modified peptide (by way of pyroGlu, amidation) therefore liver toxicity is not anticipated – resulting in a potentially superior toxicity profile</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p></li><li style="padding-left: 97pt;text-indent: -17pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">PT00114 is soluble, it can be easily formulated with clinical excipients, and it is stable when lyophilized, making it easy to package into a drug pill form.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p></li><li style="padding-left: 97pt;text-indent: -17pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">PT00114 will be manufactured by standard solid phase chemistry, which is less expensive than manufacturing processes required by other TRD drugs.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p></li><li style="padding-left: 97pt;text-indent: -17pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">It counteracts the stress effects associated with corticotropin releasing factor (CRF), a mechanism of action not yet known among today’s commercially-available TRD drugs.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p></li><li style="padding-left: 97pt;text-indent: -17pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">It increases glucose import into brain cells, thus it is potentially effective against diabetes associated depression and anxiety disorders</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p></li><li style="padding-left: 97pt;text-indent: -17pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">It increases energy metabolism likely by mitochondrial activation in brain cells</p></li></ul></ol><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: justify;">The main competitive disadvantage that PT00114 will have relative to other antidepressant drugs is that it will have fewer marketing resources behind it, assuming that the Company consummates a partnership with a large pharmaceutical company during its commercial marketing phase. Beyond this marketing resources disadvantage, the Company acknowledges that PT00114 may have efficacy disadvantages that we are not yet aware of since the drug has not yet been tested in humans. Extrapolating the early results obtained in rodent studies, PT00114 appears to be more effective and with few or no side effects, but this must be treated as an unknown since no human studies have yet been performed, and a new competitive disadvantage could be discovered during the clinical trial phase.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: justify;">Although we believe PT00114’s advantages will allow it to compete effectively against other antidepressant drugs in the TRD market, many of our competitors and potential competitors have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing approved products than we do. Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. Smaller or early stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. These third parties compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel, establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to our programs or advantageous to our business.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s13" style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Intellectual Property</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: justify;">We believe that patents, trademarks, copyrights and other proprietary rights are important to our business. We also rely on trade secrets, know-how, continuing technological innovations and licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our competitive position. We seek to protect our intellectual property rights by a variety of means, including obtaining patents, maintaining trade secrets and proprietary know-how, and technological innovation to operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of others and to prevent others from infringing on our proprietary rights. Our policy is to seek to protect our proprietary position by, among other methods, actively seeking patent protection in the United States and foreign countries.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: justify;">As of December 31, 2016, we have four patents issued by the Governments of the United States, Canada, European Union and Australia and two patent applications pending worldwide including US. The patent applications were made in the name of Dr. David A. Lovejoy and inventors, but the Company’s exclusive, worldwide rights to such patent applications are included in the License Agreement with UT.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: justify;">Our success will depend in part on our ability to maintain our proprietary position through effective patent claims and their enforcement against our competitors. Although we believe our patent applications provide a competitive advantage, the patent positions of companies like ours are generally uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions. We do not know whether any of our patent applications will result in the issuance of any patents. Those patents that may be issued in the future or those acquired by us may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented, and the rights granted under any issued patent may not provide us with proprietary protection or competitive advantages against competitors with similar technology. In particular, we do not know if competitors will be able to design variations on our treatment methods to circumvent our current and anticipated patent claims. Furthermore, competitors may independently develop similar technologies or duplicate any technology developed by us. Because of the extensive time required for the development, testing and regulatory review of a potential product, it is possible that, before any of our products can be commercialized or marketed, any related patent claim may expire or remain in force for only a short period following commercialization, thereby reducing the advantage of the patent.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 39pt;text-align: justify;">We also rely upon trade secrets, confidentiality agreements, proprietary know-how and continuing technological innovation to remain competitive, especially where we do not believe patent protection is appropriate or obtainable. We continue to seek ways to protect our proprietary technology and trade secrets, including entering into confidentiality or license agreements with our employees and consultants, and controlling access to and distribution of our technologies and other proprietary information. While we use these and other reasonable security measures to protect our trade secrets, our employees or consultants may unintentionally or willfully disclose our proprietary information to competitors.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: justify;">Our commercial success will depend in part on our ability to operate without infringing upon the patents and proprietary rights of third parties. It is uncertain whether the issuance of any third party patents would require us to alter our products or technology, obtain licenses or cease certain activities. Our failure to obtain a license to technology that we may require to discover, develop or commercialize our future products may have a material adverse impact on us. One or more third-party patents or patent applications may conflict with patent applications to which we have rights. Any such conflict may substantially reduce the coverage of any rights that may issue from the patent applications to which we have rights. If third parties prepare and file patent applications in the United States that also claim technology to which we have rights, we may have to participate in interference proceedings in the USPTO to determine priority of invention.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: justify;">We may collaborate in the future with other entities on research, development and commercialization activities. Disputes may arise about inventorship and corresponding rights in know-how and inventions resulting from the joint creation or use of intellectual property by us and our subsidiaries, collaborators, partners, licensors and consultants.

Governmental authorities in the United States extensively regulate the preclinical and clinical testing, safety, efficacy, research, development, manufacturing, labeling, storage, record-keeping, advertising, promotion, export, marketing and distribution, among other things, of pharmaceutical products under various federal laws including the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, or FFDCA, and under comparable laws by the states and in most foreign countries.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: justify;">The Company has not commenced its FDA approval application process, and does not plan to launch the FDA application process until 2022 or 2023. We cannot commence the FDA application process until we have obtained clinical human data on PT00114 in three phases of trials, none of which have been initiated. Similarly, the Company will be required to obtain regulatory approval in every country or region outside the United States into which it plans to sell its drug products. We may seek approval from authorities outside the United States such as the European Union CE Mark and Japanese Ministry of Health. As of December 31, 2016, the Company has not launched the approval application process for any region in the world because of its lack of clinical human data on PT00114.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Domestic Regulation</h4><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: justify;">In the United States, the FDA, under the FFDCA, the Public Health Service Act and other federal statutes and regulations, subject pharmaceutical and biologic products to rigorous review. If we do not comply with applicable requirements, we may be fined, the government may refuse to approve our marketing applications or allow us to manufacture or market our products or product candidates, and we may be criminally prosecuted. The FDA also has the authority to discontinue or suspend manufacture or distribution, require a product withdrawal or recall or revoke previously granted marketing authorizations, if we fail to comply with regulatory standards or if we encounter problems following initial marketing.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">FDA Approval Process</h4><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: justify;">To obtain approval of a new product from the FDA, we must, among other requirements, submit data demonstrating the product’s safety and efficacy as well as detailed information on the manufacture and composition of the product candidate. In most cases, this entails extensive laboratory tests and preclinical and clinical trials. This testing and the preparation of necessary applications and processing of those applications by the FDA are expensive and typically take many years to complete. The FDA may deny our applications or may not act quickly or favorably in reviewing these applications, and we may encounter significant difficulties or costs in our efforts to obtain FDA approvals that could delay or preclude us from marketing any products we may develop. The FDA also may require post-marketing testing and surveillance to monitor the effects of approved products or place conditions on any approvals that could restrict the commercial applications of these products. Regulatory authorities may withdraw product approvals if we fail to comply with regulatory standards or if we encounter problems following initial marketing. With respect to patented products or technologies, delays imposed by the governmental approval process may materially reduce the period during which we will have the exclusive right to exploit the products or technologies.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: justify;">The process required by the FDA before a new drug or biologic may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><ul id="l5"><li style="padding-left: 88pt;text-indent: -17pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">completion of preclinical laboratory tests or trials and formulation studies;</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p></li><li style="padding-left: 88pt;text-indent: -17pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">submission to the FDA of an IND for a new drug or biologic, which must be accepted by FDA before human clinical trials may begin;</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p></li><li style="padding-left: 88pt;text-indent: -17pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug or biologic for its intended use; and,</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p></li><li style="padding-left: 88pt;text-indent: -17pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">submission and approval of a New Drug Application, or NDA, for a drug, or a Biologic License Application, or BLA, for a biologic.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: justify;">Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry formulation and stability, as well as studies to evaluate toxicity. The results of preclinical testing, together with manufacturing information and analytical data, are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND application. The FDA requires a 30-day waiting period after the filing of each IND application before clinical trials may begin, in order to ensure that human research subjects will not be exposed to unreasonable health risks. At any time during this 30-day period or at any time thereafter, the FDA may halt proposed or ongoing clinical trials, or may authorize trials only on specified terms. The IND application process may become extremely costly and substantially delay development of our products. Moreover, positive results of preclinical tests will not necessarily indicate positive results in clinical trials.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: justify;">The sponsor typically conducts human clinical trials in three sequential phases, which may overlap. These phases generally include the following:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 80pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Phase I: The product is usually first introduced into healthy humans or, on occasion, into patients, and is tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, distribution, excretion and metabolism.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 80pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Phase II: The product is introduced into a limited patient population to:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><ul id="l6"><li style="padding-left: 106pt;text-indent: -17pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">assess its efficacy in specific, targeted indications;</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p></li><li style="padding-left: 106pt;text-indent: -17pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">assess dosage tolerance and optimal dosage; and</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p></li><li style="padding-left: 106pt;text-indent: -17pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">identify possible adverse effects and safety risks.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 80pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Phase III: These are commonly referred to as pivotal studies. If a product is found to have an acceptable safety profile and to be potentially effective in Phase II clinical trials, new clinical trials will be initiated to further demonstrate clinical efficacy, optimal dosage and safety within an expanded and diverse patient population at geographically-dispersed clinical study sites.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 80pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">If the FDA does ultimately approve the product, it may require post-marketing testing, including potentially expensive Phase IV studies, to monitor its safety and effectiveness.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: justify;">Clinical trials must meet requirements for Institutional Review Board, or IRB, oversight, informed consent and the FDA’s Good Clinical Practices. Prior to commencement of each clinical trial, the sponsor must submit to the FDA a clinical plan, or protocol, accompanied by the approval of the committee responsible for overseeing clinical trials at one of the clinical trial sites. The FDA and the IRB at each institution at which a clinical trial is being performed may order the temporary or permanent discontinuation of a clinical trial at any time if it believes that the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with FDA requirements or presents an unacceptable risk to the clinical trial patients.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: justify;">The sponsor must submit to the FDA the results of the preclinical and clinical trials, together with, among other things, detailed information on the manufacturing and composition of the product, in the form of an NDA, or, in the case of a biologic, a BLA. Once the submission has been accepted for filing, the FDA has 180 days to review the application and respond to the applicant. The review process is often significantly extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification. The FDA may refer the BLA to an advisory committee for review, evaluation and recommendation as to whether the application should be approved, but the FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: justify;">It is possible that our product candidates will not successfully proceed through this approval process or that the FDA will not approve them in any specific period of time, or at all. The FDA may deny or delay approval of applications that do not meet applicable regulatory criteria, or if the FDA determines that the clinical data do not adequately establish the safety and efficacy of the product. Satisfaction of FDA pre-market approval requirements for a new biologic is a process that may take several years and the actual time required may vary substantially based upon the type, complexity and novelty of the product or disease. The FDA reviews these applications and, when and if it decides that adequate data are available to show that the product is both safe and effective and that other applicable requirements have been met, approves the drug or biologic for marketing. Government regulation may delay or prevent marketing of potential products for a considerable period of time and impose costly procedures upon our activities. Success in early stage clinical trials does not assure success in later stage clinical trials. Data obtained from clinical activities is not always conclusive and may be susceptible to varying interpretations that could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval. Upon approval, a product candidate may be marketed only for those indications approved in the BLA or NDA and may be subject to labeling and promotional requirements or limitations, including warnings, precautions, contraindications and use limitations, which could materially impact profitability. Once</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">approved, the FDA may withdraw the product approval if compliance with pre- and post-market regulatory standards is not maintained or if safety, efficacy or other problems occur after the product reaches the marketplace.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: justify;">The FDA may, during its review of an NDA or BLA, ask for additional test data. If the FDA does ultimately approve the product, it may require post-marketing testing, including potentially expensive Phase IV studies, to monitor the safety and effectiveness of the product. In addition, the FDA may, in some circumstances, impose restrictions on the use of the product, which may be difficult and expensive to administer and may require prior approval of promotional materials.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: justify;">We have not yet begun the preparation of our IND application to begin Phase I clinical trials. We anticipate doing so in 2018. We also have not begun to prepare our application for FDA approval which we anticipate will be in 2022 or 2023. The process of collecting the clinical data needed to complete our IND application is the focus of all of our working capital, and is expected to consume all of our available capital resources over the next eighteen months. The expenditures necessary to make progress along our IND program are expected to keep our operations in a cash flow negative state for the entire period from now until and after our IND application in 2018. To maintain our liquidity, we will have to receive an influx of cash from a non-revenue source in mid-2018, from either an up-front payment from a large pharmaceutical partner or an equity financing.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Ongoing FDA Requirements</h4><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: justify;">Before approving an NDA or BLA, the FDA will inspect the facilities at which the product is manufactured and will not approve the product unless the manufacturing facilities are in compliance with the FDA’s current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMP, requirements which govern the manufacture, holding and distribution of a product. Manufacturers of biologics also must comply with the FDA’s general biological product standards. Following approval, the FDA periodically inspects drug and biologic manufacturing facilities to ensure continued compliance with the cGMP requirements. Manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the areas of production, quality control, record keeping and reporting to ensure full compliance with those requirements. Failure to comply with these requirements subjects the manufacturer to possible legal or regulatory action, such as suspension of manufacturing, seizure of product, voluntary recall of product, withdrawal of marketing approval or civil or criminal penalties. Adverse experiences with the product must be reported to the FDA and could result in the imposition of marketing restrictions through labeling changes or market removal. Product approvals may be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory requirements is not maintained or if problems concerning safety or efficacy of the product occur following approval.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: justify;">The labeling, advertising, promotion, marketing and distribution of a drug or biologic product also must be in compliance with FDA and FTC requirements which include, among others, standards and regulations for direct-to-consumer advertising, industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities, and promotional activities involving the internet. The FDA and FTC have very broad enforcement authority, and failure to abide by these regulations can result in penalties, including the issuance of a Warning Letter directing the company to correct deviations from regulatory standards, a requirement that future advertising and promotional materials be pre-cleared by the FDA and enforcement actions that can include seizures, injunctions and criminal prosecution.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: justify;">Manufacturers are also subject to various laws and regulations governing laboratory practices, the experimental use of animals and the use and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances in connection with their research. In each of the above areas, the FDA has broad regulatory and enforcement powers, including the ability to levy fines and civil penalties, suspend or delay issuance of approvals, seize or recall products and deny or withdraw approvals.</p><h4 style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">HIPAA Requirements</h4><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: justify;">Other federal legislation may affect our ability to obtain certain health information in conjunction with our research activities. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, mandates, among other things, the adoption of standards designed to safeguard the privacy and security of individually identifiable health information. In relevant part, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, has released two rules mandating the use of new standards with respect to such health information. The first rule imposes new standards relating to the privacy of individually identifiable health information. These standards restrict the manner and circumstances under which covered entities may use and disclose protected health information so as to protect the privacy of that information. The second rule released by HHS establishes minimum standards for the security of electronic health information. While we do not believe we are directly regulated as a covered entity under HIPAA, the HIPAA standards impose requirements on covered entities conducting research activities regarding the use and disclosure of individually identifiable health information collected in the course of conducting the research. As a result, unless they meet these HIPAA requirements, covered entities conducting clinical trials for us may not be able to share with us any results from clinical trials that include such health information.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: justify;">In addition to the statutes and regulations described above, we are also subject to regulation under the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Environmental Protection Act, the Toxic Substances Control Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and other present and potential future federal, state and local regulations.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s13" style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Research and Development</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: justify;">Our research and development efforts with respect to the formulations of PT00114 as our first potential product are exclusively conducted under premises of UT, Ontario, Canada. Much of our scientific research and discovery work is performed by Dr. David A. Lovejoy, our Chief Science Advisor and Dr. Dalia Barsyte, our Chief Technology Officer. These activities are funded by us under our Sponsored Research agreements with UT. We intend in the future to raise capital in distinct phases, matched to relevant scientific developments. The Company has financed completion of its preclinical proof of principle studies and the solidification of its intellectual property position through private offerings of its securities. In addition, the proceeds of bridge loans from the Company’s Chairman were used to fund research, development and the general operating activities of the Company. We anticipate that we will require additional financing through IND-enabling studies, and to support entry into clinical proof-of-concept studies in Treatment-Resistant Depression (TRD) and/or Post- Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). As we develop new product candidates, we may be required to conduct additional scientific, preclinical and as well as clinical studies. We currently have no commitments to provide us with any such additional funding.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: justify;">We incurred approximately $533,693 and $456,274 for research and development activities for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: justify;">The Company derives income from scientific research and experimental development tax credits/and or refunds issued by the Canada Revenue Agency for qualified expenditures. The credits are recognized when the refund is issued. The amounts received are reinvested into the Company’s scientific research, experimental development and operational works conducted in Canada.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s13" style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Subsidiary</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: justify;">Protagenic Therapeutics Canada (2006) Inc.

It provides operational support and assistance for the implementation of corporate and operational activities conducted in Canada. It also oversees and supports research and development activities conducted under auspices of UT. PTI Canada has three directors: Garo H. Armen (Chairman), Alexander K. Arrow and Vigen Nazarian. PTI Canada also has one part-time consultant, Robert Ziroyan. PTI Canada also benefits through tax incentive programs provided by the governments of Canada and the Province of Ontario.

We utilize our principal office for quarterly board meetings and our annual shareholder meeting. Our personnel and consultants all work remotely, the Company’s basic science laboratory work is conducted in the Lovejoy Lab at the University of Toronto, and its preclinical efficacy work is conducted at CROs. Hence the company does not have the need for a day-to-day physical office location other than a mailing address and conference room facility for meetings. For that reason, the Agenus conference room suits its purposes without imposing any inconveniences upon Agenus.

It is impossible to predict when or if any of our neuropeptide hormones will prove effective or safe in humans or will receive regulatory approval. These compounds may not demonstrate in patients the chemical and pharmacological properties ascribed to them in laboratory studies, and they may interact with human biological systems or other drugs in unforeseen, ineffective or harmful ways. If we are unable to discover or successfully develop drugs that are effective and safe in humans, we will not have a viable business.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: justify;">We may not be able to initiate and complete preclinical studies and clinical trials for our product candidates which could adversely affect our business<span class="s13">.</span></h4><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: justify;">We must successfully initiate and complete extensive preclinical studies and clinical trials for our product candidates before we can receive regulatory approval. Preclinical studies and clinical trials are expensive and will take several years to complete and may not yield results that support further clinical development or product approvals. Conducting clinical studies for any of our drug candidates for approval in the United States requires filing an IND and reaching agreement with the FDA on clinical protocols, finding appropriate clinical sites and clinical investigators, securing approvals for such studies from the independent review board at each such site, manufacturing clinical quantities of drug candidates, supplying drug product to clinical sites and enrolling sufficient numbers of participants. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to successfully accomplish all of the activities necessary to initiate and complete clinical trials.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: justify;">As a result, our preclinical studies and clinical trials may be extended, delayed or terminated, and we may be unable to obtain regulatory approvals or successfully commercialize our products.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: justify;">None of our product candidates has received regulatory approvals. If we are unable to obtain regulatory approvals to market one or more of our product candidates, our business may be adversely affected<span class="s13">.</span></h4><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: justify;">All of our product candidates are in early stages of development, and we do not expect our product candidates to be commercially available for several years, if at all. Our product candidates are subject to strict regulation by regulatory authorities in the United States and in other countries. We cannot market any product candidate until we have completed all necessary preclinical studies and clinical trials and have obtained the necessary regulatory approvals. We do not know whether regulatory agencies will grant approval for any of our product candidates. Even if we complete preclinical studies and clinical trials successfully, we may not be able to obtain regulatory approvals or we may not receive approvals to make claims about our products that we believe to be necessary to effectively market our products. Data obtained from preclinical studies and clinical trials are subject to varying interpretations that could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval, and failure to comply with regulatory requirements or inadequate manufacturing processes are examples of other problems that could prevent approval. In addition, we may encounter delays or rejections due to additional government regulation from future legislation, administrative action or changes in the FDA policy. Even if the FDA approves a product, the approval will be limited to those indications covered in the approval.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: justify;">Outside the United States, our ability to market any of our potential products is dependent upon receiving marketing approvals from the appropriate regulatory authorities. These foreign regulatory approval processes include all of the risks associated with the FDA approval process described above. If we are unable to receive regulatory approvals, we will be unable to commercialize our product candidates, and our business may fail.</p><h4 style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: justify;">We may not be able to gain market acceptance of our product candidates, which would prevent us from becoming profitable<span class="s13">.</span></h4><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: justify;">We cannot be certain that any of our product candidates will gain market acceptance among physicians, patients, healthcare payers, pharmaceutical companies or others. Demonstrating the safety and efficacy of our product candidates and obtaining regulatory approvals will not guarantee future revenue. Sales of medical products largely depend on the reimbursement of patients’ medical expenses by government healthcare programs and private health insurers. Governments and private insurers closely examine medical products to determine whether they should be covered by reimbursement and if so, the level of reimbursement that will apply. We cannot be certain that third party payers will sufficiently reimburse sales of our products, or enable us to sell our products at profitable prices. Similar concerns could also limit the reimbursement amounts that health insurers or government agencies in other countries are prepared to pay for our products. In many countries where we plan to market our products, including Europe and Canada, the pricing of prescription drugs is controlled by the government or regulatory agencies. Regulatory agencies in these countries could determine that the pricing for our products should be based on prices of other commercially available drugs for the same disease, rather than allowing us to market our products at a premium as new drugs. Sales of medical products also depend on physicians’ willingness to prescribe the treatment, which is likely to be based on a determination by these physicians that the products are safe, therapeutically effective and cost-effective. We cannot predict whether physicians, other healthcare providers, government agencies or private insurers will determine that our products are safe, therapeutically effective and cost effective relative to competing treatments.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: justify;">We may not be able to manufacture our product candidates in clinical or commercial quantities, which would prevent us from commercializing our product candidates<span class="s13">.</span></h4><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: justify;">To date, our product candidates have been manufactured in small quantities by us and third party manufacturers for preclinical studies. If any of our product candidates is approved by the FDA or other regulatory agencies for commercial sale, we will need to manufacture it in larger quantities and we intend to use third party manufacturers for commercial quantities. Our third party manufacturers may not be able to successfully increase the manufacturing capacity for any of our product candidates in a timely or efficient manner, or at all. If we are unable to successfully increase the manufacturing capacity for a product candidate, the regulatory approval or commercial launch of that product candidate may be delayed or there may be a shortage in the supply of the product candidate. Our failure or the failure of our third party manufacturers to comply with the FDA’s good manufacturing practices and to pass inspections of the manufacturing facilities by the FDA or other regulatory agencies could seriously harm our business.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: justify;">We may not be able to obtain and maintain the third party relationships that are necessary to develop, commercialize and manufacture some or all of our product candidates<span class="s13">.</span></h4><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: justify;">We expect to depend on collaborators, partners, licensees, clinical research organizations, manufacturers and other third parties to support our discovery efforts, to formulate product candidates, to conduct clinical trials for some or all of our product candidates, to manufacture clinical and commercial scale quantities of our product candidates and products and to market, sell, and distribute any products we successfully develop.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: justify;">We cannot guarantee that we will be able to successfully negotiate agreements for or maintain relationships with collaborators, partners, licensees, clinical investigators, manufacturers and other third parties on favorable terms, if at all. If we are unable to obtain or maintain these agreements, we may not be able to clinically develop, formulate, manufacture, obtain regulatory approvals for or commercialize our product candidates, which will in turn adversely affect our business.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: justify;">We expect to expend substantial management time and effort to enter into relationships with third parties and, if we successfully enter into such relationships, to manage these relationships. In addition, substantial amounts of our expenditures will be paid to third parties in these relationships. However, we cannot control the amount or timing of resources our contract partners will devote to our research and development programs, product candidates or potential product candidates, and we cannot guarantee that these parties will fulfill their obligations to us under these arrangements in a timely fashion, if at all.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: justify;">We have no experience in sales, marketing and distribution and may have to enter into agreements with third parties to perform these functions, which could prevent us from successfully commercializing our product candidates<span class="s13">.</span></h4><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: justify;">We currently have no sales, marketing or distribution capabilities. To commercialize our product candidates, we must either develop our own sales, marketing and distribution capabilities, which will be expensive and time consuming, or make arrangements with third parties to perform these services for us. If we decide to market any of our products on our own,</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">we will have to commit significant resources to developing a marketing and sales force and supporting distribution capabilities. If we decide to enter into arrangements with third parties for performance of these services, we may find that they are not available on terms acceptable to us, or at all. If we are not able to establish and maintain successful arrangements with third parties or build our own sales and marketing infrastructure, we may not be able to commercialize our product candidates which would adversely affect our business and financial condition.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: justify;">We may fail to select or capitalize on the most scientifically, clinically or commercially promising or profitable product candidates<span class="s13">.</span></h4><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: justify;">We have limited technical, managerial and financial resources to determine which of our product candidates should proceed to initial clinical trials, later stage clinical development and potential commercialization. We may make incorrect determinations. Our decisions to allocate our research and development, management and financial resources toward particular product candidates or therapeutic areas may not lead to the development of viable commercial products and may divert resources from better opportunities. Similarly, our decisions to delay or terminate drug development programs may also be incorrect and could cause us to miss valuable opportunities.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: justify;">We may not be able to maintain our exclusive worldwide license to use and develop PT00114 which could materially affect our business plan<span class="s13">.</span></h4><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: justify;">On July 21, 2005, we entered into the License Agreement with UT pursuant to which UT agreed to license to us patent rights and other intellectual property related to PT00114, among other things. The Technology License Agreement was amended on February 18, 2015. There is no expiration date to this agreement as long as we continue to provide UT with progress reports every 6 months and make ongoing progress toward development of the drug.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: justify;">Pursuant to the License Agreement, we obtained an exclusive worldwide license to make, have made, use, sell and import products based upon the Technologies, or to sublicense the Technologies in accordance with the terms of the License Agreement. In the event we fail to provide UT with semi-annual reports on our progress or fail to continue to make reasonable commercial efforts towards obtaining regulatory approval for products based on the Technologies, UT may convert our exclusive license into a non-exclusive one. In such a case, we would lose our competitive advantage in the development of treatments based on PT00114.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: justify;">If we are not able to retain our current senior management team and our scientific advisors or continue to attract and retain qualified scientific, technical and business personnel, our business will suffer<span class="s13">.</span></h4><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: justify;">We are dependent on the members of our management team and our scientific advisors for our business success. An important element of our strategy is to take advantage of the research and development expertise of our current management and to utilize the unique expertise of our scientific advisors. We do not have any employment agreements with our executive officers. The loss of any one of our executive officers or key scientific consultants, including, in particular, Garo Armen, Ph.D., Chairman of the Board, and Dr. David A. Lovejoy, our Chief Scientific Advisor, could result in a significant loss in the knowledge and experience that we, as an organization, possess and could cause significant delays, or outright failure, in the development and further commercialization of our product candidates.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: justify;">To grow, we will eventually need to hire a significant number of qualified commercial, scientific and administrative personnel. However, there is intense competition for human resources, including management in the technical fields in which we operate, and we may not be able to attract and retain qualified personnel necessary for the successful development and commercialization of our product candidates. Our inability to attract new employees or to retain existing employees could limit our growth and harm our business.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 80pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">We have not entered into an employment agreement with Dr. David A.

Lovejoy is a key contributor to our Company due to his role in the development of PT00114 and his continued role in the development of our products as our Chief Scientific Advisor. We have not entered into an employment agreement with Dr. Lovejoy. If Dr. Lovejoy elects to discontinue his service as our Chief Scientific Advisor, the development of our products and our overall business plan could be materially affected.</p><h4 style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: justify;">Disputes under key agreements or conflicts of interest with our scientific advisors or clinical investigators could delay or prevent development or commercialization of our product candidates<span class="s13">.</span></h4><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: justify;">Any agreements we have or may enter into with third parties, such as collaboration, license, formulation supplier, manufacturing, clinical research organization or clinical trial agreements, may give rise to disputes regarding the rights and obligations of the parties. Disagreements could develop over rights to ownership or use of intellectual property, the scope and direction of research and development, the approach for regulatory approvals or commercialization strategy. We intend to conduct research programs in a range of therapeutic areas, but our pursuit of these opportunities could result in conflicts with the other parties to these agreements who may be developing or selling pharmaceuticals or conducting other activities in these same therapeutic areas. Any disputes or commercial conflicts could lead to the termination of our agreements, delay progress of our product development programs, compromise our ability to renew agreements or obtain future agreements, lead to the loss of intellectual property rights or result in costly litigation.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: justify;">We collaborate with outside scientific advisors and collaborators at academic and other institutions that assist us in our research and development efforts. Our scientific advisors are not our employees and may have other commitments that limit their availability to us. If a conflict of interest between their work for us and their work for another entity arises, we may lose their services.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 80pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">We may encounter difficulties in managing our growth, which could adversely affect our operations<span class="s13">.</span></h4><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: justify;">Our ability to manage our operations and growth effectively depends upon the continual improvement of our procedures, reporting systems, and operational, financial, and management controls. We may not be able to implement improvements in an efficient or timely manner and may discover deficiencies in existing systems and controls. If we do not meet these challenges, we may be unable to take advantage of market opportunities, execute our business strategies or respond to competitive pressures which in turn may slow our growth or give rise to inefficiencies that would increase our losses.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: justify;">We may acquire additional technology and complementary businesses in the future. Acquisitions involve many risks, any one of which could materially harm our business, including the diversion of management’s attention from core business concerns, failure to exploit acquired technologies, or the loss of key employees from either our business or the acquired business.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s13" style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Company Risks</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 80pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">We have a history of losses and expect that losses may continue in the future.</h4><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: justify;">We have generated net losses since we began operations, including $2,275,826 and $1,023,422 for the years ended December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. As of December 31, 2016, we had an accumulated deficit of</p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">$8,582,123. We have no approved products and have generated no product revenue. We expect that product development, preclinical and clinical programs will increase losses significantly over the next five years. In order to achieve profitability, we will need to generate significant revenue. We cannot be certain that we will generate sufficient revenue to achieve profitability. We anticipate that we will continue to generate operating losses and negative cash flow from operations and our current cash position is sufficient to fund our current business plan at least until the third quarter of 2018. We cannot be certain that we will ever achieve, or if achieved, maintain profitability. If our revenue grows at a slower rate than we anticipate or if our product development, marketing and operating expenses exceed our expectations or cannot be adjusted accordingly, our business, results of operation and financial condition will be materially adversely affected and we may be unable to continue operations.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: justify;">We will not be able to generate product revenue unless and until one of our product candidates successfully completes clinical trials and receives regulatory approval. As our most advanced product candidates are at an early proof-of- concept stage, we do not expect to receive revenue from any product candidate for the foreseeable future. We may seek to obtain revenue from collaboration or licensing agreements with third parties. We currently have no such agreements which will provide us with material, ongoing future revenue and we may never enter into any such agreements. Even if we eventually generate revenues, we may never be profitable, and if we do achieve profitability, we may not be able to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis.</p><h4 style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 80pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">We need to obtain financing in order to continue our operations<span class="s13">.</span></h4><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: justify;">On a prospective basis, we will require both short-term financing for operations and long-term capital to fund our expected growth. We have no existing bank lines of credit and have not established any definitive sources for additional financing. We believe that cash on hand provided by the investors in the Private Offering will be sufficient to meet our short- term financial requirements for approximately twelve months. However, we will require additional funds if we want to fully implement our business plan and proceed with submission of an IND/CTA application. Additional financing may not be available to us, or if available, then it may not be available upon terms and conditions acceptable to us. If adequate funds are not available, then we may be required to delay, reduce or eliminate product development or clinical programs. Our inability to take advantage of opportunities in the industry because of capital constraints may have a material adverse effect on our business and our prospects. If we fail to obtain the capital necessary to fund our operations, we will be unable to advance our development programs and complete our clinical trials.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 35pt;text-align: justify;">In addition, our research and development expenses could exceed our current expectations.

In addition, the terms of our financings may be dilutive to, or otherwise adversely affect, holders of our common stock. We may also seek additional funds through arrangements with collaborators or other third parties. These arrangements would generally require us to relinquish rights to some of our technologies, product candidates or products, and we may not be able to enter into such agreements, on acceptable terms, if at all. If we are unable to obtain additional funding on a timely basis, we may be required to curtail or terminate some or all of our development programs, including some or all of our product candidates.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 80pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">We currently do not have sufficient cash to fully implement our business plan<span class="s13">.</span></h4><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: justify;">We have experienced a lack of adequate capital resources causing us to be unable to fully implement our business plan. We believe that we need to raise or otherwise obtain additional financing beyond the Private Offering in order to satisfy our existing obligations and fully implement our business plan. We do not expect to have positive cash flow until the middle of 2018 or longer. If we are not successful in obtaining additional financing, we will not be able to fully implement our business plan and we may not be able to continue our operations.</p><h4 style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: justify;">We have a limited operating history and a history of operating losses, and expect to incur significant additional operating losses.</h4><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: justify;">We began our business in September 2004 and have a limited operating history. Though we have enlisted the assistance of pharmaceutical and academic experts, our lack of experience may cause us to encounter unforeseen problems that could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition. As well, there is limited historical financial information upon which to base an evaluation of our performance.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: justify;">The Company’s financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, and do not include adjustments that might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern.</h4><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: justify;">The Company’s consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. As of December 31, 2016, the Company had incurred significant operating losses since inception, and continues to generate losses from operations, and has an accumulated deficit of $8,582,123. These matters raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. The consolidated financial statements incorporated in this annual report do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of asset amounts or the classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 80pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The drug development and approval process is uncertain, time-consuming and expensive.</h4><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: justify;">The process of obtaining and maintaining regulatory approvals for new therapeutic products is lengthy, expensive and uncertain. It also can vary substantially based on the type, complexity, and novelty of the product. We must provide the FDA and foreign regulatory authorities with preclinical and clinical data demonstrating that our products are safe and effective before they can be approved for commercial sale. Clinical development, including preclinical testing, is a long, expensive and uncertain process. It may take us several years to complete our testing, and failure can occur at any stage of testing. Any preclinical or clinical test may fail to produce results satisfactory to the FDA. Preclinical and clinical data can be interpreted in different ways, which could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval. Negative or inconclusive results from a preclinical study or clinical trial, adverse medical events during a clinical trial or safety issues resulting from products of the same class of drug could cause a preclinical study or clinical trial to be repeated or a program to be terminated, even if other studies or trials relating to the program are successful.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 80pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">We have to sustain and further build our intellectual property rights.</h4><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: justify;">If we fail to sustain and further build our intellectual property rights, competitors will be able to take advantage of our research and development efforts to develop competing products. If we are not able to protect our proprietary technology, trade secrets, and know-how, our competitors may use our inventions to develop competing products. Protagenic has obtained worldwide exclusive rights to PT00114 and related technology that was developed at the University of Toronto. The Company currently has four patents issued by the Governments of the United States, Canada, European Union and Australia. As of December 31, 2016, six patent applications are pending. However, our patents and patent applications, even if granted, may not protect us against our competitors. Our patent positions, and those of other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, are generally uncertain and involve complex legal, scientific and factual questions. The standards which the United States Patent and Trademark Office uses to grant patents, and the standards which courts use to interpret patents, are not always applied predictably or uniformly and can change, particularly as new technologies develop. Consequently, the level of protection, if any, that will be provided by our patents if we attempt to enforce them, and they are challenged, is uncertain. In addition, the type and extent of patent claims that will be issued to us in the future is uncertain. Any patents that are issued may not contain claims that permit us to stop competitors from using similar technology.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: justify;">In addition to our patentable technology, we also rely on unpatented technology, trade secrets, and confidential information. We may not be able to effectively protect our rights to this technology or information. Other parties may independently develop substantially equivalent information and techniques or otherwise gain access to or disclose our technology. We generally require each of our employees, consultants, collaborators, and certain contractors to execute a confidentiality agreement at the commencement of an employment, consulting, collaborative, or contractual relationship with us. However, these agreements may not provide effective protection of our technology or information or, in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure, they may not provide adequate remedies.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: justify;">Our patent position is generally uncertain and involves complex legal and factual questions. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States, and other biotechnology companies have encountered significant problems in protecting and defending their proprietary rights in foreign jurisdictions. Whether filed in the United States or abroad, our patent applications may be challenged or may fail to result in issued patents. In addition, any future patents we obtain may not be sufficiently broad to prevent others from practicing our technologies or from developing or commercializing competing products. Furthermore, others may independently develop or commercialize similar or alternative technologies or drugs, or design around our patents. Our patents may be challenged, invalidated or fail to provide us with any competitive advantages. We may not have the funds available to protect our patents or other technology; such protection is costly and can result in further litigation expenses.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: justify;">If we do not obtain or we are unable to maintain adequate patent or trade secret protection for our products in the United States, competitors could duplicate them without repeating the extensive testing that we will be required to undertake to obtain approval of the products by the FDA. Regardless of any patent protection, under the current statutory framework the FDA is prohibited by law from approving any generic version of any of our products for three years after it has approved our product. Upon the expiration of that period, or if that time period is altered, the FDA could approve a generic version of our product unless we have patent protection sufficient for us to block that generic version. Without sufficient patent protection, the applicant for a generic version of our product would be required only to conduct a relatively inexpensive study to show that its product is bioequivalent to our product and may not have to repeat the studies that we will need to conduct to demonstrate that the product is safe and effective. In the absence of adequate patent protection in other countries, competitors may similarly be able to obtain regulatory approval in those countries of products that duplicate our products.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 80pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">We have to comply with our obligations in our intellectual property licenses with third parties<span class="s13">.</span></h4><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: justify;">If we fail to comply with our obligations in our intellectual property licenses with third parties, we could lose license rights that are important to our business<span class="h4">. </span>We are a party to the License Agreement with UT under which we receive the right to practice and use important third party patent rights. We may enter into additional licenses in the future. Our existing licenses impose, and we expect future licenses will impose, various diligences, milestone payment, royalty, insurance and other obligations on us. If we fail to comply with these obligations, the licensor may have the right to terminate the license, in which event we might not be able to market any product that is covered by the licensed patents.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: justify;">We may need to resort to litigation to enforce or defend our intellectual property rights, including any patents issued to us. If a competitor or collaborator files a patent application claiming technology also invented by us, in order to protect our rights, we may have to participate in an expensive and time consuming interference proceeding before the United States Patent and Trademark Office. We cannot guarantee that our product candidates will be free of claims by third parties alleging that we have infringed their intellectual property rights. Third parties may assert that we are employing their proprietary technologies without authorization and they may resort to litigation to attempt to enforce their rights. Third parties may have or obtain patents in the future and claim that the use of our technology or any of our product candidates infringes their patents. We may not be able to develop or commercialize combination product candidates because of patent protection others have. Our business will be harmed if we cannot obtain a necessary or desirable license, can obtain such a license only on terms we consider to be unattractive or unacceptable, or if we are unable to redesign our product candidates or processes to avoid actual or  potential  patent  or  other  intellectual  property  infringement. Obtaining, protecting  and  defending  patent  and  other intellectual property rights can be expensive and may require us to incur substantial costs, including the diversion of management and technical personnel. An unfavorable ruling in patent or intellectual property litigation could subject us to significant liabilities to third parties, require us to cease developing, manufacturing or selling the affected products or using the affected processes, require us to license the disputed rights from third parties, or result in awards of substantial damages against us.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: justify;">There can be no assurance that we would prevail in any intellectual property infringement action, will be able to obtain a license to any third party intellectual property on commercially reasonable terms, successfully develop non- infringing alternatives on a timely basis, or license non-infringing alternatives, if any exist, on commercially reasonable terms. Any significant intellectual property impediment to our ability to develop and commercialize our products could seriously harm our business and prospects.</p><h4 style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: justify;">Patent litigation or other litigation in connection with our intellectual property rights may lead to publicity that may harm our reputation and the value of our common stock may decline<span class="s13">.</span></h4><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: justify;">During the course of any patent litigation, there may be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions, and other interim proceedings or developments in the litigation.

There can be no assurance that infringement or invalidity claims will not materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. Regardless of the validity or the success of the assertion of claims, we could incur significant costs and diversion of resources in protecting or defending against claims, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.

In addition, many competitors have greater name recognition and more extensive collaborative relationships. Our competitors could commence and complete clinical testing of their product candidates, obtain regulatory approvals, and begin commercial-scale manufacturing of their products faster than we are able to for our products. They could develop products that would render our product candidates, and those of our collaborators, obsolete and noncompetitive. If we are unable to compete effectively against these companies, then we may not be able to commercialize our product candidates or achieve a competitive position in the market. This would adversely affect our ability to generate revenues.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: justify;">Competition in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries may result in competing products, superior marketing of other products and lower revenues or profits for us.</h4><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: justify;">There are many companies that are seeking to develop products and therapies for the treatment of mood, anxiety and neurodegenerative disorders. Many of our competitors have substantially greater financial, technical, human and other resources than we do and may be better equipped to develop, manufacture and market technologically superior products. In addition, many of these competitors have significantly greater experience than we do in undertaking preclinical testing and human clinical studies of new pharmaceutical products and in obtaining regulatory approvals of human therapeutic products. Accordingly, our competitors may succeed in obtaining FDA approval for superior products.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 80pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Other risks and uncertainties include:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p></li></ul></li></ul></li><li style="padding-left: 88pt;text-indent: -17pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">our ability to successfully complete preclinical and clinical development of our products and services</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p></li><li style="padding-left: 88pt;text-indent: -17pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">our ability to manufacture sufficient amounts of products for development and commercialization activities</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p></li><li style="padding-left: 88pt;text-indent: -17pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">our ability to obtain, maintain and successfully enforce adequate patent and other proprietary rights protection of our products and services</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p></li><li style="padding-left: 88pt;text-indent: -17pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">the scope, validity and enforceability of patents and other proprietary rights held by third parties and their impact on our ability to commercialize our products and services</p></li><li style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 88pt;text-indent: -17pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">the accuracy of our estimates of the size and characteristics of the markets to be addressed by our products and services, including growth projections</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p></li><li style="padding-left: 88pt;text-indent: -17pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">market acceptance of our products and services</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p></li><li style="padding-left: 88pt;text-indent: -17pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">our ability to identify new patients for our products and services</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p></li><li style="padding-left: 88pt;text-indent: -17pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">the accuracy of our information regarding the products and resources of our competitors and potential competitors</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p></li><li style="padding-left: 88pt;text-indent: -17pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">the content and timing of submissions to and decisions made by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and other regulatory agencies</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p></li><li style="padding-left: 88pt;text-indent: -17pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">our ability to obtain reimbursement for our products and services from third-party payors, and the extent of such coverage</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p></li><li style="padding-left: 88pt;text-indent: -17pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">our ability to establish and maintain strategic license, collaboration and distribution arrangements</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p></li><li style="padding-left: 88pt;text-indent: -17pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">the continued funding of our collaborations and joint ventures, if any are ultimately established</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p></li><li style="padding-left: 88pt;text-indent: -17pt;text-align: justify;"><p style="display: inline;">the possible disruption of our operations due to terrorist activities and armed conflict, including as a result of the disruption of operation of our subsidiaries and our customers, suppliers, distributors, couriers, collaborative partners, licensees and clinical trial sites.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: justify;">Positive or timely results from preclinical studies and early clinical trials do not ensure positive or timely results in late stage clinical trials or product approval by the FDA or any other regulatory authority.

We may not be able to conduct clinical trials at preferred sites, enlist clinical investigators, enroll sufficient numbers of participants, or begin or successfully complete clinical trials in a timely fashion, if at all. Any failure to perform may delay or terminate the trials. Our current clinical trials may be insufficient to demonstrate that our potential products will be active, safe, or effective. Additional clinical trials may be required if clinical trial results are negative or inconclusive, which will require us to incur additional costs and significant delays.

We must obtain regulatory approval for each of our product candidates before marketing or selling any of them. It is not possible to predict how long the approval processes of the FDA or any other applicable federal or foreign regulatory authority or agency for any of our products will take or whether any such approvals ultimately will be granted. The FDA and foreign regulatory agencies have substantial discretion in the drug approval process, and positive results in preclinical testing or early phases of clinical studies offer no assurance of success in later phases of the approval process. Generally, preclinical and clinical testing of products can take many years and require the expenditure of substantial resources, and the data obtained from these tests and trials can be susceptible to varying interpretations that could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval. If we encounter significant delays in the regulatory process that result in excessive costs, this may prevent us from continuing to develop our product candidates. Any delay in obtaining, or failure to obtain, approvals could adversely affect the marketing of our products and our ability to generate product revenue. The risks associated with the approval process include:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p></li><li style="padding-left: 88pt;text-indent: -17pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">failure of our product candidates to meet a regulatory agency’s requirements for safety, efficacy and quality;</p></li><li style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 88pt;text-indent: -17pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">limitation on the indicated uses for which a product may be marketed;</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p></li><li style="padding-left: 88pt;text-indent: -17pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">unforeseen safety issues or side effects; and</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p></li><li style="padding-left: 88pt;text-indent: -17pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">governmental or regulatory delays and changes in regulatory requirements and guidelines.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: justify;">Even if we receive regulatory approvals for marketing our product candidates, if we fail to comply with continuing regulatory requirements, we could lose our regulatory approvals, and our business would be adversely affected<span class="s13">.</span></h4><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: justify;">The FDA continues to review products even after they receive initial approval. If we receive approval to commercialize any product candidates, the manufacturing, marketing and sale of these drugs will be subject to continuing regulation, including compliance with quality systems regulations, good manufacturing practices, adverse event requirements, and prohibitions on promoting a product for unapproved uses. Enforcement actions resulting from our failure to comply with government and regulatory requirements could result in fines, suspension of approvals, withdrawal of approvals, product recalls, product seizures, mandatory operating restrictions, criminal prosecution, civil penalties and other actions that could impair the manufacturing, marketing and sale of our potential products and our ability to conduct our business.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: justify;">Even if we are able to obtain regulatory approvals for any of our product candidates, if they exhibit harmful side effects after approval, our regulatory approvals could be revoked or otherwise negatively impacted, and we could be subject to costly and damaging product liability claims.</h4><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: justify;">Even if we receive regulatory approval for our product candidates, we will have tested them in only a small number of patients during our clinical trials. If our applications for marketing are approved and more patients begin to use our product, new risks and side effects associated with our products may be discovered. As a result, regulatory authorities may revoke their approvals; we may be required to conduct additional clinical trials, make changes in labeling of our product, reformulate our product or make changes and obtain new approvals for our and our suppliers’ manufacturing facilities. We might have to withdraw or recall our products from the marketplace. We may also experience a significant drop in the potential sales of our product if and when regulatory approvals for such product are obtained, experience harm to our reputation in the marketplace or become subject to lawsuits, including class actions. Any of these results could decrease or prevent any sales of our approved product or substantially increase the costs and expenses of commercializing and marketing our product.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 80pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Healthcare reform measures could adversely affect our business<span class="s13">.</span></h4><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: justify;">The efforts of governmental and third-party payers to contain or reduce the costs of healthcare may adversely affect the business and financial condition of pharmaceutical companies. In the United States and in foreign jurisdictions there have been, and we expect that there will continue to be, a number of legislative and regulatory proposals aimed at changing the healthcare system. For example, in some countries other than the United States, pricing of prescription drugs is subject to government control, and we expect proposals to implement similar controls in the United States to continue. The pendency or approval of such proposals could result in a decrease in our common stock value or limit our ability to raise capital or to enter into collaborations or license rights to our products.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: justify;">New federal legislation may increase the pressure to reduce prices of pharmaceutical products paid for by Medicare, which could adversely affect our revenues, if any<span class="s13">.</span></h4><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: justify;">The Medicare Prescription Drug Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003, or MMA, expanded Medicare coverage for drug purchases by the elderly and disabled beginning in 2006. The new legislation uses formularies, preferred drug lists and similar mechanisms that may limit the number of drugs that will be covered in any therapeutic class or reduce the reimbursement for some of the drugs in a class. More recently, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 also contained certain provisions with the potential to affect pricing of pharmaceutical products.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: justify;">As a result of the expansion of legislation, including recent healthcare insurance legislation, and the expansion of federal coverage of drug products, we expect that there will be additional pressure to contain and reduce costs. These cost reduction initiatives could decrease the coverage and price that we receive for our products in the future and could seriously harm our business. While the MMA applies only to drug benefits for Medicare beneficiaries, private payers often follow Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own reimbursement systems, and any limits on or reductions in reimbursement that occur in the Medicare program may result in similar limits on or reductions in payments from private payers.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: justify;">New federal laws or regulations on drug importation could make lower cost versions of our future products available, which could adversely affect our revenues, if any<span class="s13">.</span></h4><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: justify;">The prices of some drugs are lower in other countries than in the United States because of government regulation and market conditions. Under current law, importation of drugs into the United States is generally not permitted unless the drugs are approved in the United States and the entity that holds that approval consents to the importation. Various proposals have been advanced to permit the importation of drugs from other countries to provide lower cost alternatives to the products available in the United States. In addition, the MMA requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services to promulgate regulations for drug re-importation from Canada into the United States under some circumstances, including when the drugs are sold at a lower price than in the United States.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: justify;">If the laws or regulations are changed to permit the importation of drugs into the United States in circumstances that are currently not permitted, such a change could have an adverse effect on our business by making available lower priced alternatives to our future products.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: justify;">Failure to obtain regulatory and pricing approvals in foreign jurisdictions could delay or prevent commercialization of our products abroad<span class="s13">.</span></h4><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: justify;">If we succeed in developing any products, we intend to market them in the European Union and other foreign jurisdictions. In order to do so, we must obtain separate regulatory approvals and comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements. The approval procedure varies among countries and can involve additional testing. The time required to obtain approval abroad may differ from that required to obtain FDA approval. The foreign regulatory approval process may include all of the risks associated with obtaining FDA approval and additional risks associated with requirements particular to those foreign jurisdictions where we will seek regulatory approval of our products. We may not obtain foreign regulatory approvals on a timely basis, if at all. Approval by the FDA does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other countries, and approval by one foreign regulatory authority does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other foreign countries or by the FDA. We and our collaborators may not be able to file for regulatory approvals and may not receive necessary approvals to commercialize our products in any market outside the United States. The failure to obtain these approvals could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s13" style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Risks Related to Our Common Stock and Liquidity Risks</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: justify;">Our common stock is a “Penny Stock” subject to specific rules governing its sale to investors that could impact its liquidity.</h4><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: justify;">The SEC has adopted Rule 15g-9 which establishes the definition of a “penny stock,” for the purposes relevant to our common stock, as any equity security that has a market price of less than $5.00 per share or with an exercise price of less than $5.00 per share, subject to certain exceptions. For any transaction involving a penny stock, unless exempt, the rules require that a broker or dealer approve a person’s account for transactions in penny stocks; and the broker or dealer receive from the investor a written agreement to the transaction, setting forth the identity and quantity of the penny stock to be purchased.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: justify;">In order to approve a person’s account for transactions in penny stocks, the broker or dealer must obtain financial information and investment experience objectives of the person; and make a reasonable determination that the transactions in penny stocks are suitable for that person and the person has sufficient knowledge and experience in financial matters to be capable of evaluating the risks of transactions in penny stocks.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: justify;">The broker or dealer must also deliver, prior to any transaction in a penny stock, a disclosure schedule prescribed by the SEC relating to the penny stock market, which, in highlight form sets forth the basis on which the broker or dealer made the suitability determination, and states that the broker or dealer received a signed, written agreement from the investor prior to the transaction.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: justify;">Generally, brokers may be less willing to execute transactions in securities subject to the “penny stock” rules.

No assurance can be given that brokerage firms will want to conduct any secondary offerings on our behalf in the future.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: justify;">FINRA sales practice requirements may also limit your ability to buy and sell our common stock, which could depress the price of our shares.</h4><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: justify;">FINRA rules require broker-dealers to have reasonable grounds for believing that an investment is suitable for a customer before recommending that investment to the customer. Prior to recommending speculative low-priced securities to their non-institutional customers, broker-dealers must make reasonable efforts to obtain information about the customer’s financial status, tax status and investment objectives, among other things. Under interpretations of these rules, FINRA believes that there is a high probability such speculative low-priced securities will not be suitable for at least some customers. Thus, FINRA requirements make it more difficult for broker-dealers to recommend that their customers buy our common stock, which may limit your ability to buy and sell our shares once publicly traded, have an adverse effect on the market for our shares, and thereby depress our share price.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 80pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Compliance with the reporting requirements of federal securities laws can be expensive.</h4><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: justify;">We are a public reporting company in the United States, and accordingly, subject to the information and reporting requirements of the Exchange Act and other federal securities laws, and certain compliance obligations of the Sarbanes- Oxley Act. The costs of preparing and filing annual and quarterly reports and other information with the SEC and furnishing audited reports to stockholders are substantial.</p><h4 style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: justify;">Applicable regulatory requirements, including those contained in and issued under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, may make it difficult for us to retain or attract qualified officers and directors, which could adversely affect the management of its business and its ability to obtain or retain listing of our common stock.</h4><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: justify;">We may be unable to attract and retain those qualified officers, directors and members of board committees required to provide for effective management because of the rules and regulations that govern publicly held companies, including, but not limited to, certifications by principal executive officers. The enactment of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act has resulted in the issuance of a series of related rules and regulations and the strengthening of existing rules and regulations by the SEC, as well as the adoption of new and more stringent rules by the stock exchanges. The perceived increased personal risk associated with these changes may deter qualified individuals from accepting roles as directors and executive officers.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: justify;">Further, some of these changes heighten the requirements for board or committee membership, particularly with respect to an individual’s independence from the corporation and level of experience in finance and accounting matters. We may have difficulty attracting and retaining directors with the requisite qualifications. If we are unable to attract and retain qualified officers and directors, the management of our business and our ability to obtain or retain listing of our shares of common stock on any stock exchange (assuming we elect to seek and are successful in obtaining such listing) could be adversely affected.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: justify;">We may have undisclosed liabilities and any such liabilities could harm our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.</h4><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: justify;">Even though our pre-merger assets and liabilities were transferred in the split-off of MomSpot LLC (of which we owned a 51% interest) and 29 wholly-owned subsidiaries, we may be liable for any or all of such liabilities although we are unaware of any. Such liabilities that survived the Merger could harm our revenues, business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations upon our acceptance of responsibility for such liabilities.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: justify;">The transfer of our membership interests in MomSpot LLC and 29 of our wholly-owned subsidiaries, as well as associated assets and liabilities, will result in taxable income to us in an amount equal to the difference between the fair market value of the assets transferred and the pre-merger tax basis of the assets. Any gain recognized, to the extent not offset by our net operating loss carryforward, if any, will be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate income tax rates.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: justify;">If we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results or detect fraud.

We have been assessing our internal controls to identify areas that need improvement and will continue to monitor internal controls to improve them. Failure to implement these changes to our internal controls or any others that it identifies as necessary to maintain an effective system of internal controls could harm our operating results and cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information.

We may also issue additional shares of our common stock or other securities that are convertible into or exercisable for our common stock in connection with hiring or retaining employees, future acquisitions, future sales of our securities for capital raising purposes, or for other business purposes and some of these issuances may be at a price (or exercise prices) below the price at which shares of our common stock is currently quoted on the OTCQB.

We utilize our principal office for quarterly board meetings and our annual shareholder meeting on a month to month basis at a nominal value. Our personnel and consultants all work remotely, the Company’s basic science laboratory work is conducted in the Lovejoy Lab at the University of Toronto, and its preclinical efficacy work is conducted at CROs. Hence the company does not have the need for a day-to-day physical office location other than a mailing address and conference room facility for meetings. For that reason, the Agenus conference room suits its purposes without imposing any inconveniences upon Agenus.

There is no guarantee that an active trading market will develop in our common stock.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: justify;">Trades in our common stock may be subject to Rule 15g-9 of the Exchange Act, which imposes requirements on broker/dealers who sell securities subject to the rule to persons other than established customers and accredited investors. For transactions covered by the rule, broker/dealers must make a special suitability determination for purchasers of the securities and receive the purchaser’s written agreement to the transaction before the sale.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: justify;">The SEC also has rules that regulate broker/dealer practices in connection with transactions in “penny stocks.” Penny stocks generally are equity securities with a price of less than $5.00 (other than securities listed on certain national exchanges, provided that the current price and volume information with respect to transactions in that security is provided by the applicable exchange or system). The penny stock rules require a broker/dealer, before effecting a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from the rules, to deliver a standardized risk disclosure document prepared by the SEC that provides information about penny stocks and the nature and level of risks in the penny stock market. The broker/dealer also must provide the customer with current bid and offer quotations for the penny stock, the compensation of the broker/dealer and its salesperson in the transaction, and monthly account statements showing the market value of each penny stock held in the customer’s account. The bid and offer quotations, and the broker/dealer and salesperson compensation information, must be given to the customer orally or in writing before effecting the transaction, and must be given to the customer in writing before or with the customer’s confirmation. These disclosure requirements may have the effect of reducing the level of trading activity in the secondary market for shares of our common stock. As a result of these rules, investors may find it difficult to sell their shares.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 34pt;text-align: justify;">Our common stock was quoted on the OTC Pink under the symbol “ATRN” prior to July 27, 2016 and then under the symbol “PTIX” between July 27, 2016 and October 16, 2016.

Therefore, we do not expect to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future, if at all. Any future determination to pay dividends will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on our financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements and other factors that our board of directors deems relevant.

The Secured Convertible Notes, as revised and amended, had a maturity date of August 31, 2016 and bore interest at the rate of 5.0% per annum, payable at maturity. The outstanding principal and accrued interest of each Secured Convertible Note was convertible, subject to a 4.99% beneficial ownership cap, into shares of Atrinsic Inc.’s common stock at an initial conversion price of $5.00 per share (subject to adjustment), at the option of the respective holders.

In February 2013, in connection with a capital raise by Protagenic, the loans and accrued interest thereon, totaling</p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">$317,789, were converted into Protagenic warrants to purchase 953,367 shares of Protagenic common stock at an exercise price of $1.00 per share. Other than with respect to the payment of the purchase price for the securities by the conversion of debt, Dr. Armen participated in this capital raise on the same terms as all other investors.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: justify;">From April 15, 2015 through October 29, 2015, Dr. Armen made five loans to Protagenic. The proceeds of the loans were used to fund research, development and general operating activity of Protagenic. The loans accrued interest at the rate of 10% per annum. Principal and accrued interest on these loans, totaling approximately $350,000, were converted into shares of Series B Preferred Stock in the Private Offering at a price of $1.25 per share.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: justify;">On December 21, 2015, Alexander K.

The loans under this Agreement accrued interest at the rate of 10% per year. The principal and interest on these loans is convertible into common stock at a price of $1.25 per share. On December 23, 2015, Protagenic borrowed $37,628 of the $150,000 available Borrowings under the agreement.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: justify;">Effective June 17, 2016, the Board of Directors determined that it was in the best interest of the Company to convert the last remaining portion of debt owed to Dr. Armen into equity, per the terms of the loan agreements.

Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this report, including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business, includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. See “Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.” You should review the “Risk Factors” section of this report for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: justify;">As the result of the Merger transactions and the change in our business to a biotechnology company, a discussion of the past financial results of Predecessor is not pertinent, and the financial results of Protagenic, the accounting acquirer, are considered our financial results on a historical and going-forward basis.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: justify;">The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on Protagenic’s financial statements, which Protagenic has prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these financial statements requires Protagenic to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. On an ongoing basis, Protagenic evaluates such estimates and judgments, including those described in greater detail below. Protagenic bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that Protagenic believes are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.</p><p class="s14" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Historical Background</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: justify;">The Company was originally incorporated in Delaware on February 3, 1994 under the name Millbrook Acquisition Corp. The Company was the successor to The Millbrook Press Inc., which was a wholly-owned subsidiary of Antia Publishing Company, a Delaware corporation, which in turn was a wholly-owned subsidiary of Groupe de la Cite International, a Societe Anonyme organized under French law. In February 1994, the founders of the Company effected a management buyout by forming the Company which purchased substantially all of the assets of The Millbrook Press Inc.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: justify;">For the next 10 years, the Company was involved in a variety of attempts at creating a profitable, sustainable business model in the publishing and retail sectors, none of which succeeded. On February 6, 2004, the Company filed a voluntary petition for relief under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code with the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Connecticut and changed its name to MPLC, Inc.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: justify;">Also in 2004, a biotechnology company called Protagenic Therapeutics, Inc. (referred to herein as “Protagenic”) was organized under the name Protagenic Therapeutics, Inc., with the goal of commercializing novel peptide drugs that had been discovered in the laboratory of Dr. David Lovejoy (“The Professor”) at the University of Toronto (UofT). The Company specializes in the discovery and development of therapeutics to treat central nervous system (CNS) disorders. PTI’s mission is to provide safe and effective treatments for mood, anxiety, depression and neurodegenerative disorders by using novel peptide-base, brain active therapeutics. The Company’s strategy is to develop, test and obtain regulatory approval for various applications of these brain active therapeutics.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: justify;">On January 31, 2007, MPLC, Inc. entered into an exchange agreement with New Motion, Inc., a Delaware corporation formed in March 2005 (“New Motion”), the stockholders of New Motion (the &quot;Stockholders&quot;), and Trinad Capital Master Fund. On May 2, 2007, the Company changed its corporate name to New Motion, Inc.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: justify;">As part of a corporate re-branding strategy, on June 25, 2009, New Motion, Inc. changed its name to Atrinsic, Inc. Its new corporate image was as a provider of “digital advertising and marketing services,” primarily digital music, casual games, interactive contests, and communities/lifestyles.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: justify;">Meanwhile, from 2006 through 2014, Prior Protagenic sponsored fundamental research &amp; development work in the Professor’s lab at the UofT aimed at demonstrating the efficacy of Prior Protagenic’s lead drug candidate, known as Teneurin C-Terminus Associated Peptide, or TCAP-1, and elucidating its mechanism of action. This research resulted in a detailed understanding of the peptide and its actions on neurons. Prior Protagenic’s worldwide exclusive technology license agreement with the UofT gave it sole rights to commercialize and eventually sell drugs related to the TCAP family of proteins.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: justify;">By early 2015, it became clear that Prior Protagenic needed an influx of working capital in order to meet its goal of completing the process of applying for an Investigational New Drug (IND) application with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to sell a commercial version of TCAP-1. To secure this capital, management of Prior Protagenic chose to pursue a reverse merger and financing strategy, with the help of a placement agent. This resulted in the introduction of Prior Protagenic to the former Atrinsic, Inc., and the consummation of a memorandum of understanding (MOU) in mid-2015 that the two companies would merge and conduct an equity financing, with the former Prior Protagenic shareholders owning approximately 80% of the pre-financing entity, and the former Atrinsic, Inc. shareholders owning the other 20%.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: justify;">On February 12, 2016, Protagenic Therapeutics, Inc. merged into Protagenic Acquisition Corp., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Atrinsic, Inc., and raised gross proceeds of approximately $4.6 million in the 2016 Private Placement. All previous lines of business of Atrinsic, Inc. where theretofore dropped in favor of the field of neurologic drug development. On June 17, 2016, Protagenic Therapeutics, Inc. was merged with and into Atrinsic. Atrinsic was the surviving corporation in this merger and changed its name from Atrinsic to Protagenic Therapeutics, Inc.</p><p class="s13" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Results of Operations</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 80pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">We are a development stage company currently performing clinical trials to obtain FDA approval. We have minimal</p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">revenue.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 80pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">During the year ended December 31, 2016, we incurred a loss from operations of $2,233,501 as compared to</p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">$1,025,038 for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase in the loss is due to an increase in research and development expense of $77,419 from $456,274 for the year ended December 31, 2015 to $533,693 for the year ended December 31, 2016 due to IND-preparatory preclinical experimentation conducted during 2016 that did not have precedent during 2015, and an increase in general and administrative expenses of $726,875 from $568,764 for the year ended December 31, 2015 to</p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">$1,295,639 for the year ended December 31, 2016, which included expenses relating to the equity stock offering that occurred in February through April 2016 and the new professional fee expenses associated with being a post-merger public company. In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2016, we incurred an impairment of goodwill of $404,169 with no such impairment in the prior year. The impairment was the result of the current operating focus being shifted to the operations of Protagenic rather than the pre-merger Atrinsic, Inc.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s13" style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Liquidity</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: justify;">We continually project anticipated cash requirements, predominantly from the ongoing funding requirements of our neuropeptide drug development program. The majority of these expenses relate to paying external vendors such as Contract Research Organizations (CROs) and peptide synthesizer companies. They could also include business combinations, capital expenditures, and new drug development working capital requirements. As of December 31, 2016, we had cash of $3,100,398 and working capital of $2,475,958. We anticipate further losses in the development of our business. Based on our current forecast and budget, Management believes that our cash resources will be sufficient to fund our operations, anticipated capital expenditures and working capital for nearly two years from the date of this quarterly report. Absent generation of sufficient revenue from the execution of the Company’s business plan, we will need to obtain debt or equity financing by the third quarter of 2018.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: justify;">Operating activities used $1,140,319 and $381,341 in cash for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The use of cash in operating activities during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, was primarily used to fund our net loss.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: justify;">Our financing activities provided cash of $4,283,938 for the year ended December 31, 2016. On February 12, March 2, 2016, and April 15, 2016 we raised gross proceeds of $5,135,575 in the three closings of our Series B financing equity capital raising transaction, of which $1,850,000 was from our two principal institutional stockholders, Iroquois Capital and Hudson Bay Capital. With these proceeds, we converted $350,000 of stockholder debt to Series B preferred stock. We paid</p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">$332,000 in closing costs, including $125,000 paid on accrued liabilities, and an additional $150,000 in legal expenses netted against the $2,000,000 invested on behalf of Iroquois Capital and Hudson Bay Capital per requirements of the Merger agreement.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 80pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Within the next two years, we are likely to seek additional financing in two ways:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><ol id="l10"><li style="padding-left: 85pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><p style="display: inline;">by approaching large pharmaceutical companies who may be interested in licensing the commercial rights to our lead drug candidate, PT00114, for a non-core indication or in a non-core geographic region (such as an indication other than anxiety, depression, or addictive behavior therapy, or a region of the world other than North America or Europe). If we are successful in striking a partnership with a large pharmaceutical company in this way, we may receive an up-front licensing fee that could be significant.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p></li><li style="padding-left: 85pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><p style="display: inline;">In the absence of a licensing opportunity with a large pharmaceutical partner, we may undertake an equity financing in mid-2018, in order to raise $10 million or more in working capital to fund our first two phases of clinical trials. In this event, Management would aim to complete our IND application process prior to or coincident with this possible equity financing, because the IND submission would represent a developmental milestone that could increase the value of the Company’s equity in the view of future investors.</p></li></ol></li></ol><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: justify;">The anticipated impact on our cash position of either of these financing options would be to provide enough working capital to fund Phase I and Phase IIa clinical trials. The anticipated impact on the Company’s liquidity and operations is that the Company would be able to continue operating beyond 2018 that its current cash position provides for.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s13" style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Recent Developments</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: justify;">On February 12, 2016, we merged Protagenic Acquisition Corp (a wholly-owned subsidiary of Atrinsic, Inc.) with and into Protagenic Therapeutics, Inc. with Protagenic Therapeutics, Inc. remaining as the surviving corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Atrinisic, Inc. As a result of the merger, we acquired the business of Protagenic Therapeutics, Inc. and will continue its existing business operations. On June 17, 2016, we merged Protagenic Therapeutics, Inc. with and into Atrinsic, Inc. and changed our name to Protagenic Therapeutics, Inc.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: justify;">Simultaneously with the Merger, on February 12, 2016, we converted all of the issued and outstanding shares of the Company’s common stock, on a 1-for-1 basis, into shares of the Atrinsic’s Series B Preferred Stock, par value $0.000001 per share (“Series B Preferred Stock”). All of the issued and outstanding options to purchase shares of the Company’s common stock, and all of the issued and outstanding warrants to purchase shares of the Company’s common stock, converted, on a 1- for-1 basis, into options and new warrants, respectively, to purchase shares of Series B Preferred Stock. The new options will be administered under the Company’s 2006 Employee, Director and Consultant Stock Plan, which we assumed and adopted on February 12, 2016, in connection with the Merger.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: justify;">Concurrently with the closing of the Merger, we conducted the first closing of our 2016 Private Placement of Series B Preferred Stock. At the first closing, we sold 2,775,000 shares of Series B Preferred Stock at a purchase price of $1.25 per share, for which we received total gross consideration of $3,468,750. Of this amount, $350,000 consisted of conversion of outstanding stockholder debt held by Garo H. Armen, our chairmen and a member of our board of directors, and $150,000 of legal expenses incurred by Strategic Bio Partners LLC, stockholders of the Predecessor, in conjunction with and as allowed by the merger agreement. On March 2, 2016, we completed the second closing of the 2016 Private Placement, at which we issued an additional 913,200 shares of Series B Preferred Stock to accredited investors, for total gross proceeds of $1,141,500. On April 15, 2016, we completed the final closing of the 2016 Private Placement, at which we issued an additional 420,260 shares of Series B Preferred Stock to accredited investors, for total gross proceeds of $525,325.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: justify;">For all three closings, we raised total gross proceeds of $4,635,575 and total net proceeds of $4,261,797 (or total gross proceeds of $5,135,575 and total net proceeds of $4,783,438, including the conversion of the $350,000 in stockholder debt and $150,000 in legal expenses referred to above). We issued 4,108,460 shares of Series B Preferred Stock to investors in the 2016 Private Placement. The Placement Agent and its selected dealers were paid total cash commissions of $159,183 and the Placement Agent was paid an expense allowance of $15,000 and was issued (together with its selected dealers) Placement Agent Warrants to purchase 127,346 shares of Series B Preferred Stock at an exercise price of $1.25 per share.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: justify;">Following the final closing of the 2016 Private Placement, we registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission for resale the shares of common stock underlying the Series B Preferred Stock sold in the 2016 Private Placement and the Placement Agent Warrants.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s13" style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Plan of Operations</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Business Overview</h4><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: justify;">The Company is in its developmental stage, with encouraging but not conclusive evidence that its lead drug candidate, PT00014, may be effective as an anti-anxiety and/or anti-depression drug.

The notes to the consolidated financial statements contained in this Annual Report describe our significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ from those estimates. We continually evaluate our critical accounting policies and estimates.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: justify;">We believe the critical accounting policies listed below reflect significant judgments, estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Principles of consolidation</h4><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: justify;">The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Atrinsic, Inc., and its wholly owned subsidiary, Protagenic Acquisition Corp, and Protagenic Therapeutics, Inc., which merged with and into Protagenic Acquisition Corp, on February 12, 2016, as well as Protagenic Therapeutics’ wholly-owned Canadian subsidiary, PTI Canada.

Additionally, the accounts on the statements of operations are translated using exchange rates approximating average rates prevailing during the years. Equity accounts are translated at historical exchange rates. Translation adjustments that arise from translating its financial statements from the local currency to the U.S. dollar are accumulated and reflected as a separate component of stockholders’ equity (deficit). The current year effects of the transaction adjustments are included on the statement of operations as a realized gain (loss) on foreign transaction exchange.</span></p><p class="s14" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: justify;">Use of Estimates<span class="p">. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses as well as the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Management continually evaluates its estimates and judgments including those related to accruals, contingencies, valuation allowance for deferred tax assets, and valuation of stock options and warrants. Management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and other factors that are believed to be reasonable in the circumstances. Actual results may differ from those estimates. Macroeconomic conditions may directly, or indirectly through our business partners and vendors, impact our financial performance and available resources. Such conditions may, in turn, impact the aforementioned estimates and assumptions.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s14" style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: justify;">Fair Value Measurements.<span class="p">Accounting Standards Codification ASC 820, “Fair Value Measurements and Disclosure,” defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date, not adjusted for transaction costs. ASC 820 also establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad levels giving the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3).</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The three levels are described below:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 80pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: left;">Level 1 Inputs – Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that is accessible by the Company;</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 80pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: left;">Level 2 Inputs – Quoted prices in markets that are not active or financial instruments for which all significant inputs are observable, either directly or indirectly;</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 80pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: left;">Level 3 Inputs – Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability including significant assumptions of the Company and other market participants.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: justify;">Derivative Liability. <span class="p">The Company evaluates its options, warrants or other contracts, if any, to determine if those contracts or embedded components of those contracts qualify as derivatives to be separately accounted for in accordance with ASC 815-10-05-4 and 815-40-25. The result of this accounting treatment is that the fair value of the embedded derivative is marked-to-market each balance sheet date and recorded as either an asset or a liability. In the event that the fair value is recorded as a liability, the change in fair value is recorded in the consolidated statement of operations as other income or expense. Upon conversion, exercise or cancellation of a derivative instrument, the instrument is marked to fair value at the date of conversion, exercise or cancellation and then the related fair value is reclassified to equity.</span></h4><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: justify;">The classification of derivative instruments, including whether such instruments should be recorded as liabilities or as equity, is re-assessed at the end of each reporting period. Equity instruments that are initially classified as equity that become subject to reclassification are reclassified to liability at the fair value of the instrument on the reclassification date. Derivative instrument liabilities will be classified in the balance sheet as current or non-current based on whether or not net- cash settlement of the derivative instrument is expected within 12 months of the balance sheet date.</p><p class="s14" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: justify;">Basic and Diluted Net (Loss) per Common Share. <span class="p">Basic (loss) per common share is computed by dividing the net (loss) by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding for each period. Diluted (loss) per share is computed by dividing the net (loss) by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding plus the dilutive effect of shares issuable through the common stock equivalents. Potentially dilutive securities consisting of options and warrants aggregating 7,183,869 as of December 31, 2016, including common shares issuable under the conversion feature of the preferred shares, options and warrants issued in the Private Offering closing and merger transactions were not included in the calculation of weighted-average shares of common stock outstanding as they were determined to be anti-dilutive.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s13" style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: justify;">In November 2015, the FASB issued ASU No 2015-17, Income Taxes (Topic 740). The amendments in ASU 2015- 17 change the requirements for the classification of deferred taxes on the balance sheet. Currently, GAAP requires an entity to separate deferred income tax liabilities and assets into current and noncurrent amounts in a classified statement of financial position. To simplify the presentation of deferred income taxes, the amendments in this ASU require that deferred tax liabilities and assets be classified as noncurrent in a classified statement of financial position. The pronouncement is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016. Earlier application is permitted for all entities as of the beginning of an interim or annual reporting period. The Company has not yet selected a transition method nor has it determined the effect of the standard on its ongoing financial reporting.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: justify;">On March 30, 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09, &quot;Compensation - Stock Compensation&quot; which simplifies several aspects of the accounting for employee share-based payment transactions for both public and nonpublic entities, including the accounting for income taxes, forfeitures, and statutory tax withholding requirements, as well as classification in the statement of cash flows. For public business entities, the ASU is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those annual reporting periods. Early adoption will be permitted in any interim or annual period for which financial statements have not yet been issued or have not been made available for issuance. If early adoption is elected, all amendments in the ASU that apply must be adopted in the same period. In addition, if early adoption is elected in an interim period, any adjustments should be reflected as of the beginning of the annual period that includes that interim period. The Company is in the process of evaluating the impact of the standard on its consolidated financial statements.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: justify;">In February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2016-02, Leases. The main provisions of ASU No. 2016-02 require management to recognize lease assets and lease liabilities for all leases. ASU 2016-02 retains a distinction between finance leases and operating leases. The classification criteria for distinguishing between finance leases and operating leases are substantially similar to the classification criteria for distinguishing between capital leases and operating leases in the previous leases guidance. The result of retaining a distinction between finance leases and operating leases is that under the lessee accounting model, the effect of leases in the statement of comprehensive income and the statement of cash flows is largely unchanged from previous GAAP. The amendments in this ASU are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company is currently assessing the impact of this ASU on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: justify;">In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15, <i>“Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments” </i>(“ASU 2016-15”). ASU 2016-15 will make eight targeted changes to how cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows. ASU 2016-15 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017. The new standard will require adoption on a retrospective basis unless it is impracticable to apply, in which case it would be required to apply the amendments prospectively as of the earliest date practicable.

The updated guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption of the update is permitted.

This guidance is effective for fiscal years, and interim reporting periods therein, beginning after December 15, 2017 with early adoption permitted. The provisions of this guidance are to be applied using a retrospective approach which requires application of the guidance for all periods presented. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the new standard.

Our Executive Chairman and our Chief Financial Officer carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rule 13(a)-15(e) under the Exchange Act. Based on this evaluation, our Executive Chairman and our Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of December 31, 2016, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that the Company files or submits under the Exchange Act, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC&#39;s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the Company&#39;s management to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.</p><p class="s13" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 37pt;text-align: justify;">Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as required under applicable United States securities regulatory requirements. Internal control over financial reporting is defined in Rule 13a–15(f) or 15d–15(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act as a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company’s chief executive and chief financial officers and effected by the company’s board of directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and includes those policies and procedures that:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><ul id="l11"><li style="padding-left: 80pt;text-indent: -8pt;text-align: justify;"><p style="display: inline;">pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company;</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p></li><li style="padding-left: 80pt;text-indent: -8pt;text-align: justify;"><p style="display: inline;">provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p></li><li style="padding-left: 80pt;text-indent: -8pt;text-align: justify;"><p style="display: inline;">provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use of disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 37pt;text-align: justify;">Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risks that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 37pt;text-align: justify;">Our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016. In making this assessment, our management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”) in 2013 in Internal Control Integrated Framework. Based on that evaluation under this framework, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective because of the following significant deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p></li><li style="padding-left: 80pt;text-indent: -8pt;text-align: justify;"><p style="display: inline;">Due to our small number of employees and resources, we have limited segregation of duties, as a result of which there is insufficient independent review of duties performed;</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p></li><li style="padding-left: 80pt;text-indent: -8pt;text-align: justify;"><p style="display: inline;">As a result of the limited number of accounting personnel, we rely on outside consultants for the preparation of our financial reports, including financial statements and management discussion and analysis, which could lead to overlooking items requiring disclosure.</p></li></ul><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 37pt;text-align: justify;">This annual report does not include an attestation report by our independent registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. As we are neither a large accelerated filer nor an accelerated filer, our management’s report was not subject to attestation by our registered public accounting firm pursuant to rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission that permit us to provide only management’s report in this annual report.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s13" style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Changes in Internal Controls over Financial Reporting</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 37pt;text-align: justify;">In 2016, we hired a CFO in our finance department to enhance and strengthen our internal controls over financial reporting.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 37pt;text-align: justify;">Other than the enhancement reported above, during the year ended December 31, 2016, there have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal controls over financial reporting.

The term of the voting agreement runs until February 12, 2019 unless terminated earlier by a vote of at least 90% of the stockholders party to the agreement or the consummation of a firm commitment underwritten public offering of the Company’s common stock resulting in proceeds to the Company of at least $20 million.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s13" style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Involvement in Certain Legal Proceedings</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">To our knowledge, during the past ten years, none of our directors, executive officers, promoters, control persons, or nominees has:</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 93pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">been convicted in a criminal proceeding or been subject to a pending criminal proceeding (excluding traffic violations and other minor offenses);</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 93pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Except as set forth above with respect to Dr. Stein, had any bankruptcy petition filed by or against the business or property of the person, or of any partnership, corporation or business association of which he was a general partner or executive officer, either at the time of the bankruptcy filing or within two years prior to that time;</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 93pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">been subject to any order, judgment, or decree, not subsequently reversed, suspended or vacated, of any court of competent jurisdiction or federal or state authority, permanently or temporarily enjoining, barring, suspending or otherwise limiting, his involvement in any type of business, securities, futures, commodities, investment, banking, savings and loan, or insurance activities, or to be associated with persons engaged in any such activity;</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 93pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">been found by a court of competent jurisdiction in a civil action or by the SEC or the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to have violated a federal or state securities or commodities law, and the judgment has not been reversed, suspended, or vacated;</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 93pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">been the subject of, or a party to, any federal or state judicial or administrative order, judgment, decree, or finding, not subsequently reversed, suspended or vacated (not including any settlement of a civil proceeding among private litigants), relating to an alleged violation of any federal or state securities or commodities law or regulation, any law or regulation respecting financial institutions or insurance companies including, but not limited to, a temporary or permanent injunction, order of disgorgement or restitution, civil money penalty or temporary or permanent cease-and-desist order, or removal or prohibition order, or any law or regulation prohibiting mail or wire fraud or fraud in connection with any business entity; or</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 93pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">been the subject of, or a party to, any sanction or order, not subsequently reversed, suspended or vacated, of any self-regulatory organization (as defined in Section 3(a)(26) of the Exchange Act), any registered entity (as defined in Section 1(a)(29) of the Commodity Exchange Act), or any equivalent exchange, association, entity or organization that has disciplinary authority over its members or persons associated with a member.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s13" style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Code of Business Conduct and Ethics</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: justify;">On February 24, 2017, we adopted a written Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, Guidelines on Significant Governance Issues, and Process for Security Holder Communications with Directors, each of which is attached as an exhibit hereto.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s13" style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Board Committees</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: justify;">Our board of directors has established three standing committees: an Audit Committee, a Compensation Committee and a Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee. Each of these committees will operate under a charter that has been approved by our board of directors.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s13" style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: justify;">Audit Committee. <span class="p">The Audit Committee will oversee and monitor our financial reporting process and internal control system, review and evaluate the audit performed by our registered independent public accountants and reports to the Board any substantive issues found during the audit. The Audit Committee will be directly responsible for the appointment, compensation and oversight of the work of our registered independent public accountants. The Audit Committee will review and approve all transactions with affiliated parties. The Audit Committee shall be comprised on two or more independent directors who shall be appointed annually and subject to removal by the Board at any time. Each member of the Audit Committee shall meet the independence requirements of The NASDAQ Stock Market, LLC, and SEC regulations, as well as any other applicable requirements. On March 25, 2016, our Board appointed Messrs. Ekizian (Committee Chairperson) and Barrage to the Audit Committee, each of whom meets the independence requirements. In addition, the Board also designated Gregory Ekizian as an &quot;audit committee financial expert,&quot; as that term is defined by the NSADAQ Listing Rules and SEC regulations.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s13" style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: justify;">Compensation Committee. <span class="p">The Compensation Committee will provide advice and make recommendations to the board in the areas of employee salaries, benefit programs and director compensation.

The Compensation Committee shall be comprised on three or more directors who shall be appointed annually and subject to removal by the Board at any time. The Compensation Committee must have at least two</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">members, and must consist solely of independent directors.

The Compensation Committee shall be comprised on three or more directors who shall be appointed annually and subject to removal by the Board at any time. Each member of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee may or may not meet the independence requirements of The NASDAQ Stock Market, LLC and SEC regulations.

Our certificate of incorporation limits the liability of our directors to the fullest extent permitted by Delaware law.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: justify;">We have director and officer liability insurance to cover liabilities our directors and officers may incur in connection with their services to us, including matters arising under the Securities Act. Our certificate of incorporation and bylaws also provide that we will indemnify our directors and officers who, by reason of the fact that he or she is one of our officers or directors of our company, is involved in any action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative related to their board role with the company.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: justify;">We have entered into indemnification agreements with each of our directors and executive officers. It is anticipated that future directors and officers will enter into an Indemnification Agreement with us in substantially similar form. The Indemnification Agreement provides, among other things, that we will indemnify and hold harmless each person subject to an Indemnification Agreement (each, an “Indemnified Party”) to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law from and against all losses, costs, liabilities, judgments, penalties, fines, expenses and other matters that may result or arise in connection with such Indemnified Party serving in his or her capacity as a director of ours or serving at our direction as a director, officer, employee, fiduciary or agent of another entity. The Indemnification Agreement further provides that, upon an Indemnified Party’s request, we will advance expenses to the Indemnified Party to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law. Pursuant to the Indemnification Agreement, an Indemnified Party is presumed to be entitled to indemnification and we have the burden of proving otherwise. The Indemnification Agreement also requires us to maintain in full force and effect directors’ liability insurance on the terms described in the Indemnification Agreement. If indemnification under the Indemnification Agreement is unavailable to an Indemnified Party for any reason, we, in lieu of indemnifying the Indemnified Party, will contribute to any amounts incurred by the Indemnified Party in connection with any claim relating to an indemnifiable event in such proportion as is deemed fair and reasonable in light of all of the circumstances to reflect the relative benefits received or relative fault of the parties in connection with such event.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: justify;">Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act may be permitted to our directors, officers, and controlling persons pursuant to the foregoing provisions, or otherwise, we have been advised that in the opinion of the Securities and Exchange Commission such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and is, therefore, unenforceable. In the event that a claim for indemnification against such liabilities (other than the payment of expenses incurred or paid by a director, officer or controlling person in a successful defense of any action, suit or proceeding) is asserted by such director, officer or controlling person in connection with the securities being registered, we will, unless in the opinion of its counsel the matter has been settled by controlling precedent, submit to the court of appropriate jurisdiction the question whether such indemnification by it is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and will be governed by the final adjudication of such issue.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: justify;">There is no pending litigation or proceeding involving any of our directors, officers, employees or agents in which indemnification will be required or permitted. We are not aware of any threatened litigation or proceeding that may result in a claim for such indemnification.</p><p class="s13" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Item 11.

Stock unit awards may be granted with dividend equivalent rights, which may be accumulated and may be deemed reinvested in additional stock units, as determined by the Compensation Committee in its discretion. If any dividend equivalents are paid while a stock unit award is subject to restrictions, the dividend equivalents shall be subject to the same restrictions on transferability as the underlying stock units, unless otherwise set forth in an award agreement.

This summary is not intended to be exhaustive and does not address all matters relevant to a particular participant based on his or her specific circumstances. The summary expressly does not discuss the income tax laws of any state, municipality, or non-U.S. taxing jurisdiction, or the gift, estate, excise (including the rules applicable to deferred compensation under Code Section 409A), or other tax laws other than federal income tax law. The following is not intended or written to be used, and cannot be used, for the purposes of avoiding taxpayer penalties.

For non-statutory stock options and stock appreciation rights, the participant will recognize ordinary income upon exercise in an amount equal to the difference between the fair market value of the shares and the exercise price on the date of exercise. Any gain or loss recognized upon any later disposition of the shares generally will be a capital gain or loss.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: justify;">The acquisition of shares upon exercise of an incentive stock option will not result in any taxable income to the participant, except, possibly, for purposes of the alternative minimum tax. The gain or loss recognized by the participant on a later sale or other disposition of such shares will either be long-term capital gain or loss or ordinary income, depending upon whether the participant holds the shares for the legally-required period (two years from the date of grant and one year from the date of exercise). If the shares are not held for the legally-required period, the participant will recognize ordinary income equal to the lesser of (i) the difference between the fair market value of the shares on the date of exercise and the exercise price, or (ii) the difference between the sales price and the exercise price, and the balance of the gain, if any, will be afforded capital gain treatment.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: justify;">For awards of stock grants, the participant will not have taxable income upon the receipt of the award (unless the participant elects to be taxed at the time of the stock is granted rather than when it becomes vested). The stock grants will generally be subject to tax upon vesting as ordinary income equal to the fair market value of the shares at the time of vesting less the amount paid for such shares (if any).</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: justify;">A participant is not deemed to receive any taxable income at the time an award of restricted stock units is granted. When vested restricted stock units (and dividend equivalents, if any) are settled and distributed, the participant will recognize ordinary income equal to the amount of cash and/or the fair market value of shares received less the amount paid for such restricted stock units (if any).</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: justify;">If the participant is an employee or former employee, the amount a participant recognizes as ordinary income in connection with any award is subject to withholding taxes (not applicable to incentive stock options) and the Company is allowed a tax deduction equal to the amount of ordinary income recognized by the participant. In addition, Code</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Section 162(m) contains special rules regarding the federal income tax deductibility of compensation paid to the Company’s chief executive officer and to certain of the Company’s other executive officers. The general rule is that annual compensation paid to any of these specified executives will be deductible only to the extent that it does not exceed $1,000,000. However, the Company can preserve the deductibility of certain compensation in excess of $1,000,000 if such compensation qualifies as “performance-based compensation” by complying with certain conditions imposed by the Code Section 162(m) rules (including the establishment of a maximum number of shares with respect to which awards may be granted to any one employee during one fiscal year).</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s13" style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Option Grants and Stock Awards</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: justify;">As of December 31, 2016, we had outstanding stock options to purchase 2,627,229 shares at an average exercise price of approximately $1.05 per share. Included in the total outstanding stock options were 117,784 stock options granted under the 2006 Plan in 2016 at an exercise price of $1.25 and 1,333,299 nonqualified stock options granted under the 2016 Plan in 2016 to our executive officers and others at an exercise price of $1.25 per share.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: justify;">All awards to be made under the 2016 Plan are discretionary, subject to the terms of the 2016 Plan.

Hence the company does not have the need for a day-to-day physical office location other than a mailing address and conference room facility for meetings. For that reason, the Agenus conference room suits its purposes without imposing any inconveniences upon Agenus. .

(“IMF”). Josh Silverman, who became one of our directors upon the closing of the Merger, is an affiliate of IMF. The Secured Convertible Notes, as revised and amended, had a maturity date of August 31, 2016 and bore interest at the rate of 5.0% per annum, payable at maturity. The outstanding principal and accrued interest of each Secured Convertible Note was convertible, subject to a 4.99% beneficial ownership cap), into shares of Atrinsic’s common stock at an initial conversion price of $5.00 per share (subject to adjustment), at the option of the respective holders. IMF exchanged the Secured Convertible Notes that it held for 147,972 Predecessor Warrants, which Predecessor Warrants were issued to the Designee at the closing of the Merger, and the instruments by which the Secured Convertible Notes were secured were simultaneously terminated.</p><p class="s13" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Transactions Relating to Protagenic</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: justify;">Garo H. Armen, our Chairman and principal stockholder, purchased shares of Series B Preferred Stock in the Private Offering in exchange for the cancellation of $350,000 of loans made by him, plus accrued and unpaid interest on these loans.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: justify;">During 2013 and 2012, Dr. Armen made loans to us in the amount of $310,000. The proceeds of the loans were used to fund research, development and general operating activity of Protagenic. The loans accrued interest at the rate of 10% per annum. In February 2013, in connection with a capital raise by Protagenic, the loans and accrued interest thereon, totaling</p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">$317,789, were converted into Protagenic warrants to purchase 953,367 shares of Protagenic common stock at an exercise price of $1.00 per share. Other than with respect to the payment of the purchase price for the securities by the conversion of debt, Dr. Armen participated in this capital raise on the same terms as all other investors.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: justify;">From April 15, 2015 through October 29, 2015, Dr. Armen made five loans to Protagenic. The proceeds of the loans were used to fund research, development and general operating activity of Protagenic. The loans accrued interest at the rate of 10% per annum. Principal and accrued interest on these loans, totaling approximately $350,000, were converted into shares of Series B Preferred Stock in the Private Offering at a price of $1.25 per share.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: justify;">On December 21, 2015, Alexander K.

In addition, Dr. Arrow purchased 58,260 shares of Series B Preferred Stock in the Private Offering, on the same terms as all other investors.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: justify;">Effective December 23, 2015, Dr. Armen entered into an additional loan agreement with Protagenic pursuant to which he agreed to loan Protagenic up to $150,000. The loans under this Agreement accrued interest at the rate of 10% per year. The principal and interest on these loans is convertible into common stock at a price of $1.25 per share. On December 23, 2015, Protagenic borrowed $37,628 of the $150,000 available Borrowings under the agreement.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: justify;">Effective June 17, 2016, the Board of Directors determined that it was in the best interest of the Company to convert the last remaining portion of debt owed to Dr. Armen into equity, per the terms of the loan agreements. The sum total of remaining debt and accumulated interest as of December 31, 2016 was $0.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s13" style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Merger Transaction</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: justify;">On February 12, 2016, which we refer to as the Merger Closing Date, Atrinsic, Inc., Protagenic Therapeutics, Inc. and Protagenic Acquisition Corp., Atrinsic, Inc.’s wholly-owned subsidiary, entered into a merger agreement and completed the merger contemplated by the merger agreement. Pursuant to the merger agreement, on the Merger Closing Date, Protagenic Acquisition Corp. merged with and into Protagenic Therapeutics, Inc., with Protagenic Therapeutics, Inc. remaining as the surviving entity and wholly-owned subsidiary of Atrinsic, Inc. On June 17, 2016, we merged our wholly-owned subsidiary Protagenic Therapeutics, Inc. with and into the Company and we changed our name from Atrinsic, Inc. to Protagenic Therapeutics, Inc.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: justify;">While we believe that all of these agreements and arrangements are in the best interests of our Company, related parties of the Placement Agent may derive material benefits as the result of these transactions.

Any request for us to enter into a transaction with a related party, in which the amount involved exceeds $100,000 and such related party would have a direct or indirect interest must first be presented to our audit committee, or in certain circumstances the chairman of our audit committee, for review, consideration and approval. In approving or rejecting any such proposal, our audit committee, or the chairman of our audit committee, is to consider the material facts of the transaction, including, but not limited to, whether the transaction is on terms no less favorable than terms generally available to an unaffiliated third party under the same or similar circumstances, the extent of the benefits to us, the availability of other sources of comparable products or services and the extent of the related party’s interest in the transaction.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s13" style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Director Independence</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: justify;">We are not currently listed on any national securities exchange or in an inter-dealer quotation system that has a requirement that the Board of Directors be independent. However, in evaluating the independence of our members and the composition of the committees of our Board of Directors, our Board utilizes the definition of “independence” as that term is defined by applicable listing standards of the NASDAQ Stock Market and SEC rules, including the rules relating to the independence standards of an audit committee and the non-employee director definition of Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: justify;">Our Board of Directors expects to continue to evaluate its independence standards and whether and to what extent the composition of the Board and its committees meets those standards. We ultimately intend to appoint such persons to our Board and committees of our Board as are expected to be required to meet the corporate governance requirements imposed by a national securities exchange. Therefore, we intend that a majority of our directors will be independent directors of which at least one director will qualify as an “audit committee financial expert,” within the meaning of Item 407(d)(5) of Regulation S-K, as promulgated by the SEC.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: justify;">We believe that Messrs.

(the “Company”) as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, and the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss, stockholders’ equity (deficit) and cash flows for the years then ended. These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. Our audits included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Protagenic Therapeutics, Inc., as of December 31, 2016 and 2015 and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.</p><p

style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: justify;">Protagenic Therapeutics, Inc. (“we,” “our,” “Protagenic” or “the Company”), a Delaware corporation with one subsidiary named Protagenic Therapeutics Canada (2006) Inc., a corporation formed in 2006 under the laws of the Province of Ontario, Canada.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: justify;">The Company was most recently known as Atrinsic, Inc., a company that was once a reporting company under the Securities Act, but that, in 2012 and 2013, reorganized under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code and emerged from bankruptcy. On February 12, 2016, the Company acquired Protagenic Therapeutics, Inc. through a reverse merger. On June 17, 2016, Protagenic Therapeutics, Inc. (the then wholly-owned subsidiary of Atrinsic, Inc.) was merged with and into Atrinsic, Inc. Atrinsic, Inc. was the surviving corporation in this merger and changed its name from Atrinsic, Inc. to Protagenic Therapeutics, Inc.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: justify;">The Company originally incorporated as a Delaware corporation under the name Millbrook Acquisition Corp. in 1994. In 2007, Millbrook Acquisition Corp. changed its name to New Motion, Inc. In 2008, New Motion, Inc. merged with Traffix, Inc., pursuant to which Traffix, Inc. became a wholly-owned subsidiary of New Motion, Inc. In 2009, New Motion, Inc. changed its name to Atrinsic, Inc. On June 15, 2012, the Company filed Chapter 11 in the United States Bankruptcy Court in Southern District of New York (Case No. 12-12553). As of that date, the Company terminated all remaining employees and ceased normal business operations.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: justify;">Prior to March 30, 2012, the Company was a reporting company under the Exchange Act, and filed periodic reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). On March 30, 2012, the Company filed a Form 15 with the SEC, terminating its obligation to file periodic reports under Sections 13 and 15(d) of the Exchange Act. Prior to the filing of our Plan of Reorganization under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code on June 15, 2012 (the “Plan of Reorganization”), the Company was a marketer of direct-to-consumer subscription products and an Internet search marketing agency. The Company sold entertainment and lifestyle subscription products directly to consumers, which the Company marketed through the Internet. The Company also sold Internet marketing services to our corporate and advertising clients.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: justify;">The Company emerged from Chapter 11 on June 26, 2013, at which time the Plan of Reorganization was conditionally confirmed by the United States Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York. The confirmation was subject to the consummation of the Company’s acquisition of a 51% controlling interest in MomSpot LLC (“MomSpot”), which was subsequently completed on July 12, 2013 (“Emergence Date”). MomSpot’s goal was to be the premier specialty retail affiliate marketing company targeting women between the ages of 24 and 45 who are either mothers or expecting their first child. The Emergence Date was the date the Company adopted fresh start accounting in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 852. The adoption of fresh-start accounting resulted in the Company becoming a new entity for financial reporting purposes. At that time, our principal activities were conducted through MomSpot.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: justify;">On February 12, 2016, the Company acquired Protagenic Therapeutics, Inc. (referred to herein as “Prior Protagenic”) through a reverse merger, pursuant to which all the issued and outstanding shares of Protagenic common stock converted on a 1-for-1 basis into shares of the Company’s Series B Preferred Stock, par value $0.000001 per share. Concurrently with the reverse merger, the Company conducted the first closing of a private offering of our Series B Preferred Stock.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: justify;">Since the fourth quarter of the 2015 fiscal year, MomSpot’s development plans have been suspended pending receipt of incremental funding. On February 12, 2016, the Company sold its 51% interest of MomSpot to the remaining 49% interest holder through a split off agreement. Additionally, on February 12, 2016, the Company sold its equity interests in 29 wholly- owned subsidiaries.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: justify;">Protagenic Therapeutics Canada (2006) Inc. (“PTI Canada”) was incorporated in 2006 in the Province of Ontario, Canada. PTI Canada was a wholly-owned subsidiary of Prior Protagenic, and following the Special Meeting, as defined in</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Note 7 below, it became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. PTI Canada provides operational support and assistance for the implementation of corporate and operational activities conducted in Canada.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Reverse Business Combination (Merger)</h4><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: justify;">On February 12, 2016 (“Closing Date”), Protagenic Acquisition Corp., a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company (which at the time was named Atrinsic, Inc.), merged (the “Merger”) with and into Prior Protagenic. Prior Protagenic was the surviving corporation of the Merger. As a result of the Merger, the Company acquired the business of prior Protagenic and will continue the existing business operations of Prior Protagenic as a wholly-owned subsidiary. On June 17, 2016, Prior Protagenic merged with and into the Company with the Company as the surviving corporation in the merger. Immediately thereafter, the Company changed its name from Atrinsic, Inc. to Protagenic Therapeutics, Inc.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: justify;">On the Closing Date, all of the issued and outstanding (6,612,838) shares of Prior Protagenic common stock converted, on a 1 for 1 basis, into shares of the Company’s Series B Convertible Preferred Stock, par value $0.000001 per share (“Series B Preferred Stock”). Also on the Closing Date, all of the issued and outstanding options to purchase shares of Prior Protagenic common stock, and all of the issued and outstanding warrants to purchase shares of Prior Protagenic common stock, converted, on a 1 for 1 basis, into options (the “New Options”) and warrants (the “New Warrants”) respectively, to purchase shares of Series B Preferred Stock. New Options to purchase 1,807,744 shares of Series B Preferred Stock, having an average exercise price of approximately $0.87 per share, were issued to Prior Protagenic optionees. New Warrants to purchase 3,403,367 shares of Series B Preferred Stock at an average exercise price of approximately $1.03 per share were issued to holders of Prior Protagenic warrants.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: justify;">The common stockholders of Atrinsic, Inc. before the Merger (“Predecessor”) retained 25,867 shares of common stock, par value $0.0001 per share (the “Common Stock”). Upon the effectiveness of the Merger, the holders of the Predecessor’s Series A Preferred Stock exchanged all of the issued and outstanding Series A Preferred Stock for an aggregate of 297,468 shares of Series B Preferred Stock. In addition, the holders of options to purchase Predecessor common stock were issued options (“Predecessor Options”) to purchase 17,784 shares of Series B Preferred Stock at $1.25 per share. Warrants (“Predecessor Warrants”) to purchase 295,945 shares of Series B Preferred Stock at $1.25 per share were issued to Strategic Bio Partners, LLC, the designee (the “Designee”) of the holders of the Predecessor’s debt in consideration of the cancellation of such debt amounting to $665,000 in principal and $35,000 in interest.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: justify;">The Merger is being accounted for as a “Reverse Business Combination,” and Prior Protagenic is deemed to be the accounting acquirer in the merger. Consequently, the assets and liabilities and the historical operations that will be reflected in the financial statements prior to the Merger will be those of Prior Protagenic, and the consolidated financial statements after completion of the Merger will include the assets and liabilities of Prior Protagenic, historical operations of Prior Protagenic and combined operations of Prior Protagenic, Predecessor and the Company from the Closing Date of the Merger. Further, as a result of the issuance of the shares of Series B Preferred Stock pursuant to the Merger, a change in control of the Company occurred as of the date of consummation of the Merger.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 35pt;text-align: justify;">The Merger will be treated as a recapitalization of the Company for financial accounting purposes. The historical financial statements of Predecessor before the Merger will be replaced with the historical financial statements of Prior Protagenic before the Merger in all future filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”).</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: justify;">At the closing of the Merger, Predecessor had a 51% interest in MomSpot, and the remaining 49% was held by B.E. Global LLC. Barry Eisenberg is the sole owner of B.E. Global LLC and is the Chief Executive Officer of MomSpot LLC. Immediately after the closing of the Merger, the Company split off its 51% membership interests in MomSpot. The split-off was accomplished through the transfer of all of its membership interests of MomSpot, having nominal value, to B.E. Global LLC via a split off agreement for nominal consideration.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: justify;">Immediately after the closing of the Merger, the Company also split off all of its equity interest in 29 wholly-owned subsidiaries of Predecessor. The split-off was accomplished through the sale of all equity interests in these wholly-owned subsidiaries to Quintel Holdings, Inc. for nominal considerations via a split off agreement. These entities had nominal value.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Private Offering</h4><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: justify;">Concurrently and a condition of the closing of the Merger, the Company conducted the first closing of an offering (the “Private Offering”) of our Series B Preferred Stock. At the first closing, we sold 2,775,000 shares of Series B Preferred Stock at a purchase price of $1.25 per share, for which we received total gross consideration of $3,468,750. Of this amount,</p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">$350,000 consisted of the conversion of outstanding stockholder debt held by Garo H. Armen, our chairman and a member</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">of our board of directors, and $150,000 of legal expenses incurred by Strategic Bio Partners, LLC, on behalf of the stockholders of Predecessor, in conjunction with and as permitted under the terms of the Merger. On March 2, 2016, we completed the second closing of the Private Offering, at which we sold an additional 913,200 shares of Series B Preferred Stock, for total gross proceeds of $1,141,500. On April 15, 2016 we completed the final closing of the Private Offering, at which we issued an additional 420,260 shares of Series B Preferred Stock to accredited investors, for total gross proceeds of</p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">$525,325. The Company paid commissions, legal and miscellaneous fees aggregating $373,778 associated with these closings. We also issued Placement Agent Warrants to purchase 127,346 shares of Series B Preferred Stock valued at</p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">$146,641 using a Black-Scholes model at an exercise price of $1.25 per share to the Placement Agent and its selected dealers. The Company determined the fair value of the binomial lattice model and the Black-Scholes valuation model to be materially the same. For all three closings, the Company issued 4,108,460 shares of Series B Preferred Stock and raised total gross proceeds of $4,635,575 and total net proceeds of $4,261,797 (or total gross proceeds of $5,135,575 and total net proceeds of</p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">$4,761,797 , including the conversion of the $350,000 in principal of stockholder debt, and $150,000 of legal expenses incurred by the Predecessor’s stockholders.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s13" style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Debt Exchange</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 80pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Simultaneous with the Merger and the Private Offering, holders of $665,000 of Predecessor debt accompanied with</p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">$35,000 in accrued interest exchanged such debt for Predecessor Warrants to purchase 295,945 shares of Series B Preferred Stock at $1.25 per share. The Predecessor Warrants were valued at $340,784 (see Note 6).</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s13" style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Reverse Stock Split</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: justify;">On June 17, 2016, the Company held a Special Meeting of Stockholders (the “Special Meeting”). At the Special Meeting, the Company’s stockholders approved a third amendment and restatement (the “Third Amendment and Restatement”) to the Company’s Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, effective July 27, 2016 (the “Effective Time”), to effect a one-for-15,463.7183 reverse split of the Company’s common stock (the “Reverse Stock Split”). Pursuant to the Reverse Stock Split, at the Effective Time, each 15,463.7183 shares of common stock owned by a stockholder were combined into one new share of common stock, with any fractional shares that would otherwise be issuable as a result of the Reverse Stock Split being rounded up to the nearest whole share. The Third Amendment and Restatement also effected (i) a reduction in the Company’s authorized shares of common stock from 100 billion shares to 100 million shares, (ii) an increase in the par value of the Company’s common stock from $0.000001 per share to $0.0001 per share and (iii) a reduction in the Company’s authorized shares of preferred stock from 5 billion shares to 20 million shares.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: justify;">As a result of the Reverse Split, 400,000,000 shares of common stock were split into 25,867 shares of common stock. Additionally, as a result of the Reverse Split and in accordance with our certificate of designations for our Series B Preferred Stock, our Series B Preferred Stock immediately and automatically converted into our common stock on a 1-for-1 basis other than any Series B Preferred Stock (i) to the extent (but only to the extent) a Series B Preferred Stock holder would beneficially own greater than 9.99% of our common stock (the “Springing Blocker”) and (ii) such holder has notified the Company in writing that it wants the Springing Blocker to apply to such holder. On July 27, 2016, 10,146,000 of the Company’s 11,018,766 outstanding shares of Series B Preferred Stock were eligible to immediately convert into 10,146,000 shares of the Company’s common stock with 872,766 shares of Series B Preferred Stock remaining as a result of one holder exercising the Springing Blocker. As of December 31, 2016, 10,146,000 shares of the Series B Preferred Stock were converted into 10,146,000 shares of common stock on the records of the Company.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: justify;">Any Series B Preferred Stock not converted as a result of this provision would automatically convert into common stock as soon as such conversion would not violate the Springing Blocker. Our Series B Preferred Stock will cease to be designated as a separate series of our preferred stock when all of such shares have converted into shares of our common stock.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 80pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">All share and per share amounts for the common stock have been retroactively restated to give effect to the reverse</p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">split.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s13" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">NOTE 2 - LIQUIDITY</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: justify;">As shown in the accompanying consolidated financial statements, the Company incurred a net loss of $2,275,826 and $1,023,442 for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The Company has incurred losses since inception resulting in an accumulated deficit of $8,582,123 as of December 31, 2016. The net loss presented for the twelve months is attributed to goodwill impairment, an increase in professional fees as related to the Merger, and an increase in stock compensation expense. The net loss present for the prior period was attributed to stock compensation expense and research</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">and development expenses. The Company anticipates further losses in the development of its business. The Company had a net working capital of $2,475,958 at December 31, 2016 as a result of the Merger and simultaneous financings. Based on its current forecast and budget, Management believes that its cash resources will be sufficient to fund its operations at least until the third quarter of 2018. Absent generation of sufficient revenue from the execution of the Company’s business plan, it will need to obtain debt or equity financing by the third quarter of 2018.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s13" style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">NOTE 3 - SUMMARY OF SIGNFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Basis of presentation</h4><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: justify;">The Company’s consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“US GAAP”) and the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”).</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Principles of consolidation</h4><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: justify;">The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Atrinsic, Inc., and its wholly owned subsidiary, Protagenic Acquisition Corp, and Protagenic Therapeutics, Inc., which merged with and into Protagenic Acquisition Corp, on February 12, 2016, as well as Protagenic Therapeutics’ wholly-owned Canadian subsidiary, PTI Canada. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in the consolidated financial statements.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Use of estimates</h4><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: justify;">The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with US GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expense during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Significant estimates underlying the consolidated financial statements include the allocation of the fair value of acquired assets and liabilities associated with the Merger, assessment of goodwill and income tax provisions and allowances, impairment of goodwill, valuation of stock options and warrants and assessment of deferred tax valuation allowance. The Company also relies on estimates for the valuation of stock-based compensation expense and financial instruments.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Concentrations of Credit Risk</h4><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: justify;">The Company maintains its cash accounts at financial institutions which are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (&quot;FDIC&quot;). At times, the Company may have deposits in excess of federally insured limits.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Cash and Cash Equivalents</h4><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: justify;">The Company considers all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents. As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, the Company did not have any cash equivalents.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Equipment</h4><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: justify;">Equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Cost includes expenditures for computer equipment. Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred. When assets are sold, retired, or otherwise disposed of, the cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and any resulting gain or loss is reflected in operations. The cost of equipment is depreciated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the related assets which is 3 years.

accounted for in accordance with ASC 815-10-05-4 and 815-40-25. The result of this accounting treatment is that the fair value of the embedded derivative is marked-to-market each balance sheet date and recorded as either an asset or a liability. In the event that the fair value is recorded as a liability, the change in fair value is recorded in the consolidated statement of operations as other income or expense. Upon conversion, exercise or cancellation of a derivative instrument, the instrument is marked to fair value at the date of conversion, exercise or cancellation and then the related fair value is reclassified to equity.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: justify;">The classification of derivative instruments, including whether such instruments should be recorded as liabilities or as equity, is re-assessed at the end of each reporting period. Equity instruments that are initially classified as equity that become subject to reclassification are reclassified to liability at the fair value of the instrument on the reclassification date. Derivative instrument liabilities will be classified in the balance sheet as current or non-current based on whether or not net- cash settlement of the derivative instrument is expected within 12 months of the balance sheet date.</p><h4 style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Stock-Based Compensation</h4><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: justify;">The Company accounts for stock based compensation costs under the provisions of ASC 718, “Compensation— Stock Compensation”, which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense related to the fair value of stock based compensation awards that are ultimately expected to vest. Stock based compensation expense recognized includes the compensation cost for all stock based payments granted to employees, officers, and directors, based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of ASC 718.

Section 830-10-45 sets out the guidance relating to how a reporting entity determines the functional currency of a foreign entity (including of a foreign entity in a highly inflationary economy), re- measures the books of record (if necessary), and characterizes transaction gains and losses. Pursuant to Section 830-10-45, the assets, liabilities, and operations of a foreign entity shall be measured using the functional currency of that entity. An entity’s functional currency is the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates; normally, that is the currency of the environment, or local currency, in which an entity primarily generates and expends cash.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: justify;">The functional currency of each foreign subsidiary is determined based on management’s judgment and involves consideration of all relevant economic facts and circumstances affecting the subsidiary. Generally, the currency in which the subsidiary transacts a majority of its transactions, including billings, financing, payroll and other expenditures, would be considered the functional currency, but any dependency upon the parent and the nature of the subsidiary’s operations must also be considered. If a subsidiary’s functional currency is deemed to be the local currency, then any gain or loss associated with the translation of that subsidiary’s financial statements is included in accumulated other comprehensive income. However, if the functional currency is deemed to be the U.S. Dollar, then any gain or loss associated with the re-measurement of these financial statements from the local currency to the functional currency would be included in the consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income (loss). If the Company disposes of foreign subsidiaries, then any cumulative translation gains or losses would be recorded into the consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income (loss). If the Company determines that there has been a change in the functional currency of a subsidiary to the U.S. Dollar, any translation gains or losses arising after the date of change would be included within the statement of income and comprehensive income (loss).</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: justify;">Based on an assessment of the factors discussed above, the management of the Company determined the relevant subsidiary’s local currency to be the functional currency for its foreign subsidiary.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Recent Accounting Pronouncements</h4><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: justify;">In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014- 09 (ASU 2014-09), Revenue from Contracts with Customers. ASU 2014-09 will eliminate transaction- and industry-specific revenue recognition guidance under current GAAP and replace it with a principle based approach for determining revenue recognition. ASU 2014-09 will require that companies recognize revenue based on the value of transferred goods or services as they occur in the contract. ASU 2014-09 also will require additional disclosure about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from customer contracts, including significant judgments and changes in judgments and assets recognized from costs incurred to obtain or fulfill a contract. ASU 2014-09 is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted only as of annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim reporting periods within that reporting period. Entities will be able to transition to the standard either retrospectively or as a cumulative-effect adjustment as of the date of adoption. The adoption of ASU 2014- 09 is not expected to have any impact on the Company’s financial statement presentation or disclosures.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: justify;">In August 2014, the FASB Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) issued ASU No. 2014-15, <i>“Presentation of Financial Statements-Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40): Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity’s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern.” </i>ASU 2014-15 provides guidance on management’s responsibility to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about an organization’s ability to continue as a going concern and to provide related footnote disclosures. For each reporting period, management will be required to evaluate whether there are conditions or events that raise substantial doubt about a company’s ability to continue as a going concern within one year from the date the financial statements are issued. The amendments in ASU 2014-15 are effective for annual reporting periods ending after December 15, 2016, and for annual and interim periods thereafter. Early adoption is permitted. The Company has elected to adopt the methodologies prescribed by ASU 2014-15. The adoption of ASU 2014-15 had no material effect on its financial position or results of operations.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: justify;">In November 2015, the FASB issued ASU No 2015-17, Income Taxes (Topic 740). The amendments in ASU 2015- 17 change the requirements for the classification of deferred taxes on the balance sheet. Currently, GAAP requires an entity to separate deferred income tax liabilities and assets into current and noncurrent amounts in a classified statement of financial position. To simplify the presentation of deferred income taxes, the amendments in this ASU require that deferred tax liabilities and assets be classified as noncurrent in a classified statement of financial position. The pronouncement is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016. Earlier application is permitted for all entities as of the beginning of an interim or annual reporting period. The Company does not believe the adoption of this standard will have a material effect on the Company’s consolidated financial position and results of operations.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: justify;">In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases. The main provisions of ASU No. 2016-02 require management to recognize lease assets and lease liabilities for all leases. ASU 2016-02 retains a distinction between finance leases and operating leases. The classification criteria for distinguishing between finance leases and operating leases are substantially similar to the classification criteria for distinguishing between capital leases and operating leases in the previous leases guidance. The result of retaining a distinction between finance leases and operating leases is that under the lessee accounting model, the effect of leases in the statement of comprehensive income and the statement of cash flows is largely unchanged from previous GAAP. The amendments in this ASU are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company is currently assessing the impact of this ASU on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: justify;">On March 30, 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09, &quot;Compensation - Stock Compensation&quot; which simplifies several aspects of the accounting for employee share-based payment transactions for both public and nonpublic entities, including the accounting for income taxes, forfeitures, and statutory tax withholding requirements, as well as classification in the statement of cash flows. For public business entities, the ASU is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those annual reporting periods. Early adoption will be permitted in any interim or annual period for which financial statements have not yet been issued or have not been made available for issuance. If early adoption is elected, all amendments in the ASU that apply must be adopted in the same period. In addition, if early adoption is elected in an interim period, any adjustments should be reflected as of the beginning of the annual period that includes that interim period. The Company is currently assessing the impact of this ASU on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: justify;">In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15, <i>“Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments” </i>(“ASU 2016-15”). ASU 2016-15 will make eight targeted changes to how cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows. ASU 2016-15 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017. The new standard will require adoption on a retrospective basis unless it is impracticable to apply, in which case it would be required to apply the amendments prospectively as of the earliest date practicable. The Company is currently assessing the impact of this ASU on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: justify;">In October 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-16, “Income Taxes (Topic 740): Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other than Inventory”, which eliminates the exception that prohibits the recognition of current and deferred income tax effects for intra-entity transfers of assets other than inventory until the asset has been sold to an outside party. The updated guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption of the update is permitted. The Company is currently assessing the impact of this ASU on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: justify;">In November 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-18, “Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230)”, requiring that the statement of cash flows explain the change in the total cash, cash equivalents, and amounts generally described as restricted cash or restricted cash equivalents. This guidance is effective for fiscal years, and interim reporting periods therein, beginning after December 15, 2017 with early adoption permitted. The provisions of this guidance are to be applied using a retrospective approach which requires application of the guidance for all periods presented. The Company is currently assessing the impact of this ASU on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: justify;">In December 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-20, “Technical Corrections and Improvements to Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers”. The amendments in this Update affect the guidance in Update 2014-09, which is not yet effective. The effective date and transition requirements for the amendments are the same as the effective date and transition requirements for Topic 606 (and any other Topic amended by Update 2014-09). Accounting Standards Update No. 2015-14, <i>Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of the Effective Date</i>, defers the effective date of Update 2014-09 by one year.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><table style="border-collapse:collapse;margin-left:42.399pt" cellspacing="0"><tr style="height:17pt"><td style="width:420pt"><p class="s24" style="padding-left: 2pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">NOTE 4 -
